IT project directors must stay informed of current technological trends and have solid understanding of systems capabilities. They participate in training efforts of junior staff members and cultivate business partnerships with vendors to obtain cost savings. In all tasks, the IT project director must follow company privacy and security policies to prevent data loss and theft. These professionals generally report to the senior management of their department.\r\nA bachelor's degree in information technology, computer science, or a related field is generally required for this position. Previous experience in a similar position, as well as industry and leadership certifications, may be preferred. IT project directors must be able to multitask, as well as have leadership skills necessary to motivate subordinate IT professionals to complete projects in a timely manner.
