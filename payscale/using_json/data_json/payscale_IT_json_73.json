                    "description": "Certified records managers are responsible for managing their companies' records, whether they are in physical or electronic formats (or both), and may also help their companies devise more efficient methods of managing records. These managers should always stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the records management field, which  includes being aware of any laws or regulations that have changed.\r\nThese managers ensure that data is only kept for as long as it is allowed to be kept according to company policies and federal, state, and local laws. They also work with the internal legal department and information technology (IT) department to determine whether methods of record-keeping adhere to these regulations and laws. Sometimes, requests to acquire records will be made by certain departments or personnel, and the certified records manager must ensure that the request is valid and then authorize or decline it. They may also be in charge of developing training documents or materials regarding use and disclosure of data and administering such training, so public speaking skills are highly beneficial in this position.\r\nA bachelor’s degree in business administration and prior experience in the field are generally required for this position, and some employers may require a master’s degree. To gain certification as a certified records manager, an exam must be taken after completing one year of professional records and information management, and completion of some relevant courses may also be necessary to do so.",

These managers should always stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the records management field, which  includes being aware of any laws or regulations that have changed.\r\nThese managers ensure that data is only kept for as long as it is allowed to be kept according to company policies and federal, state, and local laws. They also work with the internal legal department and information technology (IT) department to determine whether methods of record-keeping adhere to these regulations and laws. Sometimes, requests to acquire records will be made by certain departments or personnel, and the certified records manager must ensure that the request is valid and then authorize or decline it. They may also be in charge of developing training documents or materials regarding use and disclosure of data and administering such training, so public speaking skills are highly beneficial in this position.\r\nA bachelor’s degree in business administration and prior experience in the field are generally required for this position, and some employers may require a master’s degree. To gain certification as a certified records manager, an exam must be taken after completing one year of professional records and information management, and completion of some relevant courses may also be necessary to do so.",
