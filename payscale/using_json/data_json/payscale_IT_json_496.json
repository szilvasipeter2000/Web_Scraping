Many companies prefer applicants who have at least a Bachelor's degree in Business, Economics, or a related field, although some companies will accept experience substituted for education.\r\nIdeally, SEO account managers should have multiple years of experience in technical search engine optimization, as well as additional experience in project management, enterprise-level SEO, and more depending on the company's needs. They must have a very thorough understanding of search engine optimization and the software, platforms, and techniques that are used in the field. It is also beneficial for these managers to be up-to-date on current trends and techniques and continue to develop their skills over time.\r\nSEO account managers work exclusively indoors, usually at a desk and computer. Their main responsibility is to perform SEO-related tasks and consulting for clients, which range from improving the visibility of websites on search engine pages to reporting estimations in traffic. There are various day-to-day tasks they will need to perform, such as keyword research and using crowd-sourcing platforms. They will also need good communication skills, as they will be in regular contact with clients to present findings and results, train them in search engine optimization, and provide technical support if any issues arise.",

Many companies prefer applicants who have at least a Bachelor's degree in Business, Economics, or a related field, although some companies will accept experience substituted for education.\r\nIdeally, SEO account managers should have multiple years of experience in technical search engine optimization, as well as additional experience in project management, enterprise-level SEO, and more depending on the company's needs. They must have a very thorough understanding of search engine optimization and the software, platforms, and techniques that are used in the field. It is also beneficial for these managers to be up-to-date on current trends and techniques and continue to develop their skills over time.\r\nSEO account managers work exclusively indoors, usually at a desk and computer. Their main responsibility is to perform SEO-related tasks and consulting for clients, which range from improving the visibility of websites on search engine pages to reporting estimations in traffic. There are various day-to-day tasks they will need to perform, such as keyword research and using crowd-sourcing platforms. They will also need good communication skills, as they will be in regular contact with clients to present findings and results, train them in search engine optimization, and provide technical support if any issues arise.",
