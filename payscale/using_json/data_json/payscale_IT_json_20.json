The development director coordinates all team leads on the development project, as well as sets measurable goals and deadlines for these teams and stays in contact with team leads to ensure the project proceeds on schedule. These projects may be as diverse as developing a new intranet for company use and developing new reporting and assessment tools to be shared across departments and teams. The director is often responsible for continuing to improve applications that help maintain and improve the security of sensitive organizational emails. \r\nMuch of this job may include striking a balance among various teams in the organizations to ensure IT projects move forward in an efficient manner. The development director may also work with managers in quality assurance testing to ensure that new applications are working as intended, while also taking feedback to add features or functionality requested by these quality teams.\r\nTo work as an applications development director for IT/information systems, a person typically must possess at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field; however, many companies prefer postbaccalaureate education as well. Experience in management for IT applications development and programming is generally required as well. The development director must have excellent communication and organizational skills. ",

The development director coordinates all team leads on the development project, as well as sets measurable goals and deadlines for these teams and stays in contact with team leads to ensure the project proceeds on schedule. These projects may be as diverse as developing a new intranet for company use and developing new reporting and assessment tools to be shared across departments and teams. The director is often responsible for continuing to improve applications that help maintain and improve the security of sensitive organizational emails. \r\nMuch of this job may include striking a balance among various teams in the organizations to ensure IT projects move forward in an efficient manner. The development director may also work with managers in quality assurance testing to ensure that new applications are working as intended, while also taking feedback to add features or functionality requested by these quality teams.\r\nTo work as an applications development director for IT/information systems, a person typically must possess at least a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field; however, many companies prefer postbaccalaureate education as well. Experience in management for IT applications development and programming is generally required as well. The development director must have excellent communication and organizational skills. ",
