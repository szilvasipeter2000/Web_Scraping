                    "description": "Information technology (IT) quality assurance managers are commonly found in technology companies and other industries that use information technology. Their primary role is to oversee quality control systems in product/service operations and in training; this involves analyzing policies and procedures and adjusting them as needed, as well as enforcing these rules within the company. In many cases, this includes directly supervising workers and carefully inspecting work produced by employees. It is also necessary to carefully analyze and interpret data to prepare reports and feedback for management.\r\nTo successfully perform these duties, communication, leadership, and organizational skills are needed, as well as strong attention to detail. In some cases, IT quality assurance managers must have technical knowledge of specific fields and services to efficiently measure productivity and maintain quality levels. These professionals may also need to quickly learn specific software for controlling and monitoring quality on the job; this software is often specific to companies and previous experience may not be required.\r\nThis work is often done in small teams, so managing and training other quality assurance staff may be necessary. Work is typically performed indoors in an office environment, with travel fairly limited. These individuals typically work during regular business hours, but overtime may be required depending on project requirements.\r\nThe minimum educational requirement for this position typically includes a bachelor's degree in a related field. Previous experience in IT quality assurance is generally needed as well.",

                    "description": "Information technology (IT) quality assurance managers are commonly found in technology companies and other industries that use information technology. Their primary role is to oversee quality control systems in product/service operations and in training; this involves analyzing policies and procedures and adjusting them as needed, as well as enforcing these rules within the company. In many cases, this includes directly supervising workers and carefully inspecting work produced by employees. It is also necessary to carefully analyze and interpret data to prepare reports and feedback for management.\r\nTo successfully perform these duties, communication, leadership, and organizational skills are needed, as well as strong attention to detail. In some cases, IT quality assurance managers must have technical knowledge of specific fields and services to efficiently measure productivity and maintain quality levels. These professionals may also need to quickly learn specific software for controlling and monitoring quality on the job; this software is often specific to companies and previous experience may not be required.\r\nThis work is often done in small teams, so managing and training other quality assurance staff may be necessary. Work is typically performed indoors in an office environment, with travel fairly limited. These individuals typically work during regular business hours, but overtime may be required depending on project requirements.\r\nThe minimum educational requirement for this position typically includes a bachelor's degree in a related field. Previous experience in IT quality assurance is generally needed as well.",
