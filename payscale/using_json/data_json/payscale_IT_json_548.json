                    "description": "Senior internet/communication engineers are responsible for all internet and communication features and transmissions on behalf of their company, as well as planning communication equipment upgrades and installation. They must possess strong leadership and interpersonal skills to interact and motivate a group of engineers to reach all company goals within specific time frames. They must work well in a team setting with other senior engineers, but also perform efficiently on their own with minimal supervision. They should have advanced technical knowledge of both communication methods and internet engineering to provide the most reliable service at all times.\r\nOne of the main tools of a senior internet/communication engineer is a personal computer to design communication channels and develop plans to use fewer company resources and increase productivity. Those in this position also assist in training tasks for junior engineers and participate in business meetings to suggest new technologies. Senior internet/communication engineers must focus their attention on optimization efforts, such as technology strategies that integrate voice and video protocols, and also prepare test cases prior to software development, troubleshoot faulty devices, and follow established regulations when adapting hardware in different locations. \r\nA bachelor's degree in communications engineering or a related field is generally required; prior experience in a communications engineering position is often necessary as well. Industry and leadership certifications may also be beneficial.",

They must possess strong leadership and interpersonal skills to interact and motivate a group of engineers to reach all company goals within specific time frames. They must work well in a team setting with other senior engineers, but also perform efficiently on their own with minimal supervision. They should have advanced technical knowledge of both communication methods and internet engineering to provide the most reliable service at all times.\r\nOne of the main tools of a senior internet/communication engineer is a personal computer to design communication channels and develop plans to use fewer company resources and increase productivity. Those in this position also assist in training tasks for junior engineers and participate in business meetings to suggest new technologies. Senior internet/communication engineers must focus their attention on optimization efforts, such as technology strategies that integrate voice and video protocols, and also prepare test cases prior to software development, troubleshoot faulty devices, and follow established regulations when adapting hardware in different locations. \r\nA bachelor's degree in communications engineering or a related field is generally required; prior experience in a communications engineering position is often necessary as well. Industry and leadership certifications may also be beneficial.",
