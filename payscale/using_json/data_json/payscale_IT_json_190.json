                    "description": "Desktop support managers are responsible for the smooth operation of a team of workers whose primary function is to help customers resolve issues with their desktop computers. As such, they should have considerable experience with personnel management, as well as comprehensive knowledge of computers and their many possible malfunctions. Generally, desktop support managers are required to have at least a Bachelor's degree in an information technology-related field, although some in this position reach it in another way, perhaps by starting with a help desk position.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, most desktop support managers work in indoor office environments, and often oversee a group of workers in a cubicle environment. While many enjoy standard (first-shift) 40-hour work weeks, some companies operate in a 24-hour capacity, so it is possible that such a manager could work second- or even third-shift hours.\r\n\r\nDay-to-day responsibilities of a desktop support manager may include scheduling staff, developing manuals or best practices for desktop support teams to follow, designing standardized builds for desktop machines, and even training new employees on requisite software. There are dozens of different packages available to help IT staff track and deliver service to users; as such, the manager is often required to be knowledgeable of, or even certified in, whichever software package their company has chosen for the function.\r\n\r\nIf hired early enough in a company’s inception phase (or if they are fortunate enough to work there via expansions), desktop support managers will likely be called upon to help spec out desktop machines for various levels of users within a company. And, while their work is largely mental, there may also be occasions where they must roll up their sleeves and help with the actual physical deployment of desktop machines.",

                    "description": "Desktop support managers are responsible for the smooth operation of a team of workers whose primary function is to help customers resolve issues with their desktop computers. As such, they should have considerable experience with personnel management, as well as comprehensive knowledge of computers and their many possible malfunctions. Generally, desktop support managers are required to have at least a Bachelor's degree in an information technology-related field, although some in this position reach it in another way, perhaps by starting with a help desk position.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, most desktop support managers work in indoor office environments, and often oversee a group of workers in a cubicle environment. While many enjoy standard (first-shift) 40-hour work weeks, some companies operate in a 24-hour capacity, so it is possible that such a manager could work second- or even third-shift hours.\r\n\r\nDay-to-day responsibilities of a desktop support manager may include scheduling staff, developing manuals or best practices for desktop support teams to follow, designing standardized builds for desktop machines, and even training new employees on requisite software. There are dozens of different packages available to help IT staff track and deliver service to users; as such, the manager is often required to be knowledgeable of, or even certified in, whichever software package their company has chosen for the function.\r\n\r\nIf hired early enough in a company’s inception phase (or if they are fortunate enough to work there via expansions), desktop support managers will likely be called upon to help spec out desktop machines for various levels of users within a company. And, while their work is largely mental, there may also be occasions where they must roll up their sleeves and help with the actual physical deployment of desktop machines.",
