                    "description": "A network engineering director is a highly-placed information technology (IT) executive who helps make and implement decisions regarding how a company shares data across various fields. The network engineering director is particularly concerned with the actual physical equipment and infrastructure of the data network and generally helps design and execute hardware decisions to manage capacity and bandwidth and assure adequate storage.\r\nAs a director, much of the work revolves around making high-level decisions regarding implementation and upgrades of hardware to increase the efficiency with which an organization's intranet for internal sharing is handled, as well as how it handles consumer-based traffic. Engineering directors are often absorbed in making hardware-related decisions on server technology and upgrades.\r\nThese directors' jobs may also involve supervising the maintenance of the existing network infrastructure. They typically receive reports from IT department leaders regarding key areas such as data throughput, bandwidth benchmarks, and storage use, and then assess the efficiency of the network hardware and work with their IT managers to develop solutions to prevent down-times and bottlenecks throughout the system. As director-level executives, they may also report to other executives and any board members regarding network needs, requirements, and performance over a given period of time.\r\nMost network engineering directors should have at least a four-year degree in computer engineering or an IT engineering discipline. Many employers search for applicants who have extensive experience in middle management or as a team leader in network infrastructure positions. Most executives at this level work long hours during the week in an office environment, but should expect occasional field trips or business travel, as well.",

                    "description": "A network engineering director is a highly-placed information technology (IT) executive who helps make and implement decisions regarding how a company shares data across various fields. The network engineering director is particularly concerned with the actual physical equipment and infrastructure of the data network and generally helps design and execute hardware decisions to manage capacity and bandwidth and assure adequate storage.\r\nAs a director, much of the work revolves around making high-level decisions regarding implementation and upgrades of hardware to increase the efficiency with which an organization's intranet for internal sharing is handled, as well as how it handles consumer-based traffic. Engineering directors are often absorbed in making hardware-related decisions on server technology and upgrades.\r\nThese directors' jobs may also involve supervising the maintenance of the existing network infrastructure. They typically receive reports from IT department leaders regarding key areas such as data throughput, bandwidth benchmarks, and storage use, and then assess the efficiency of the network hardware and work with their IT managers to develop solutions to prevent down-times and bottlenecks throughout the system. As director-level executives, they may also report to other executives and any board members regarding network needs, requirements, and performance over a given period of time.\r\nMost network engineering directors should have at least a four-year degree in computer engineering or an IT engineering discipline. Many employers search for applicants who have extensive experience in middle management or as a team leader in network infrastructure positions. Most executives at this level work long hours during the week in an office environment, but should expect occasional field trips or business travel, as well.",
