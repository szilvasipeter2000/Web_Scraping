They are responsible for creating applications for electrical projects, working with automation tools to develop effective electrical solutions that are scalable, and following strict safety regulations when installing and deploying electrical applications. They actively participate in the electrical design and building of power systems, as well as troubleshoot application scripts and improve efficiency by removing code that is not longer needed. Additionally, these engineers use a personal computer to develop electrical applications using project requirements based on their engineering expertise. \r\nElectrical applications engineers participate in technical meetings to suggest changes to electrical specifications, as well as help with the development of technical documentation and create detailed reports based on their performance and findings. They share technical and applications data with other departments, take part in the electrical applications testing and maintenance, and provide support for troubleshooting activities. Electrical applications engineers coordinate equipment selection, installation, and performance review. They report their progress to the electrical applications supervisor in their department and escalate safety concern as required. \r\nA bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or a related field is required for this position. Previous experience in an electrical engineering role is generally required or preferred, and industry certifications may be beneficial. Electrical applications engineers must be results-driven, have strong analytical skills, pay close attention to detail, and be able to multitask on a variety of projects. They need to be able to work well with other applications engineers in a team environment to reach all company objectives in a timely manner; however, they should also be able to perform effectively on their own with minimal supervision.

They are responsible for creating applications for electrical projects, working with automation tools to develop effective electrical solutions that are scalable, and following strict safety regulations when installing and deploying electrical applications. They actively participate in the electrical design and building of power systems, as well as troubleshoot application scripts and improve efficiency by removing code that is not longer needed. Additionally, these engineers use a personal computer to develop electrical applications using project requirements based on their engineering expertise. \r\nElectrical applications engineers participate in technical meetings to suggest changes to electrical specifications, as well as help with the development of technical documentation and create detailed reports based on their performance and findings. They share technical and applications data with other departments, take part in the electrical applications testing and maintenance, and provide support for troubleshooting activities. Electrical applications engineers coordinate equipment selection, installation, and performance review. They report their progress to the electrical applications supervisor in their department and escalate safety concern as required. \r\nA bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or a related field is required for this position. Previous experience in an electrical engineering role is generally required or preferred, and industry certifications may be beneficial. Electrical applications engineers must be results-driven, have strong analytical skills, pay close attention to detail, and be able to multitask on a variety of projects. They need to be able to work well with other applications engineers in a team environment to reach all company objectives in a timely manner; however, they should also be able to perform effectively on their own with minimal supervision.
