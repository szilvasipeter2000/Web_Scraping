Although HCI design can be as basic as working with user interfaces, many designers also work in specialized fields to help disabled people work with computers in general. \r\nThose in this position may work with foreign, non-roman alphabets and other input variations which affect designs, and may also present computers to emerging world cultures which have little experience with them. Generally, these designers work to make the ways people use computers as easy as possible.\r\nHCI designers usually work from a series of challenges, such as designing input keyboards with braille alphabets for the blind or optimizing simple mouse commands for those who may be unable to move a mouse. They may design hardware or software which assist these users in interacting with their computers, and they also adjust and improve designs based upon target-user testing and feedback.\r\nHCI designers often work with interfaces and input/output designed for specific audiences; this can include designing input/output for those with learning disabilities. They may have to improve the usability of system software for foreign cultures, especially those which are less technologically experienced.\r\nMost HCI designers work either in specialized divisions of large software development companies or smaller, interface-related boutique companies, and a college degree in computer science or a related field is generally required for this position. Most work in a computer office environment during traditional weekly business hours.",

Although HCI design can be as basic as working with user interfaces, many designers also work in specialized fields to help disabled people work with computers in general. \r\nThose in this position may work with foreign, non-roman alphabets and other input variations which affect designs, and may also present computers to emerging world cultures which have little experience with them. Generally, these designers work to make the ways people use computers as easy as possible.\r\nHCI designers usually work from a series of challenges, such as designing input keyboards with braille alphabets for the blind or optimizing simple mouse commands for those who may be unable to move a mouse. They may design hardware or software which assist these users in interacting with their computers, and they also adjust and improve designs based upon target-user testing and feedback.\r\nHCI designers often work with interfaces and input/output designed for specific audiences; this can include designing input/output for those with learning disabilities. They may have to improve the usability of system software for foreign cultures, especially those which are less technologically experienced.\r\nMost HCI designers work either in specialized divisions of large software development companies or smaller, interface-related boutique companies, and a college degree in computer science or a related field is generally required for this position. Most work in a computer office environment during traditional weekly business hours.",
