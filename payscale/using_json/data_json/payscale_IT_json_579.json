The senior storage analyst needs to perform regular backups to ensure that no data is lost; these backups need to be tested regularly to make sure that they are functioning properly. The senior storage analyst also ensures that no data is accessed by unauthorized parties and that adequate security measures are in place. The senior storage analyst needs to carry out maintenance, often at regular intervals, to make sure that the servers are performing at their optimal levels. When operations are not working as they should, the analyst needs to carry out tests to troubleshoot the issues and correct the problems. \r\nAlso, the storage analyst needs to be able to provide support to authorized individuals trying to access their data. This often requires working in a data center or server room. The senior storage analyst needs to be up to date with new developments in the field; when developments occur, the senior analyst must present suggestions for changes so management can authorize them as needed. The analyst may also need to make changes to information technology policy at the company. \r\nA minimum of a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information systems, or a similar discipline is often required. Many positions require adequate experience in the field as well. Additionally, some positions may require experience with certain software programs such as Microsoft WSUS and SCCMA.",

The senior storage analyst needs to perform regular backups to ensure that no data is lost; these backups need to be tested regularly to make sure that they are functioning properly. The senior storage analyst also ensures that no data is accessed by unauthorized parties and that adequate security measures are in place. The senior storage analyst needs to carry out maintenance, often at regular intervals, to make sure that the servers are performing at their optimal levels. When operations are not working as they should, the analyst needs to carry out tests to troubleshoot the issues and correct the problems. \r\nAlso, the storage analyst needs to be able to provide support to authorized individuals trying to access their data. This often requires working in a data center or server room. The senior storage analyst needs to be up to date with new developments in the field; when developments occur, the senior analyst must present suggestions for changes so management can authorize them as needed. The analyst may also need to make changes to information technology policy at the company. \r\nA minimum of a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information systems, or a similar discipline is often required. Many positions require adequate experience in the field as well. Additionally, some positions may require experience with certain software programs such as Microsoft WSUS and SCCMA.",
