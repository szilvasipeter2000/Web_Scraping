The applications developed by those in this position are also used to edit and analyze data and create maps.\r\nThis type of developer programs enhancements to existing software, such as web-based applications, which are customized to the client's needs. For example, a client might be searching for the right location to open a business, so the developer would create an application to collect and analyze customer data to benefit the client. The developer may also maintain hardware such as computers or GPS units and provide technical support to application users by diagnosing and fixing problems with their programs.\r\nTo become a GIS developer, several qualifications may be required. A college degree in Computer Science or GIS in particular is usually required. He/she should be entirely familiar with a number of computer programming platforms and languages. Finally, they should have experience with GIS software and knowledge of field data collection techniques, database management systems, and Structured Query Language.\r\nA GIS developer should have strong critical thinking and communication skills and be comfortable with statistical analysis and analyzing spatial data. Those in this position are typically employed by a large company or other entity, be it a commercial organization, educational institution, or the government. They may work either for the company or its clients, but usually within a team of software developers. They spend the majority of their work hours at their desk and computer.",
