When PACS analysts work in the medical or healthcare industry, they work with computer systems that maintain images from various medical imaging instruments, such as ultrasound images. They are responsible for maintaining their company’s PAC computer systems and databases.  They must ensure optimum and efficient performance of automated systems.  PAC analysts maintain and manage very complex information system products.  They are involved in technical and application reviews to be used by their company.  They help determine if the systems being reviewed are feasible, efficient, and cost effective.  They provide input on the systems’ usefulness to their company’s operations.  They may have to meet with computer and software vendors directly.  They work closely with computer programmers and software engineers.  \r\nPAC analysts must have a bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology, or another relevant fields.  They must possess relevant work experience.  However, some companies will accept candidates with significant experience as PACS analysts in lieu of a bachelor's degree. They must have excellent oral and written communication skills.  They must have good presentation skills.  They must be able to work in a team environment. They need to be able to troubleshoot system issues.  They must keep themselves up to date with relevant technology available in the market place.  They may have to attend various training classes, workshops, and conferences.  They may have to train and coach new PAC analysts.\r\n",

When PACS analysts work in the medical or healthcare industry, they work with computer systems that maintain images from various medical imaging instruments, such as ultrasound images. They are responsible for maintaining their company’s PAC computer systems and databases.  They must ensure optimum and efficient performance of automated systems.  PAC analysts maintain and manage very complex information system products.  They are involved in technical and application reviews to be used by their company.  They help determine if the systems being reviewed are feasible, efficient, and cost effective.  They provide input on the systems’ usefulness to their company’s operations.  They may have to meet with computer and software vendors directly.  They work closely with computer programmers and software engineers.  \r\nPAC analysts must have a bachelor's degree in computer science, information technology, or another relevant fields.  They must possess relevant work experience.  However, some companies will accept candidates with significant experience as PACS analysts in lieu of a bachelor's degree. They must have excellent oral and written communication skills.  They must have good presentation skills.  They must be able to work in a team environment. They need to be able to troubleshoot system issues.  They must keep themselves up to date with relevant technology available in the market place.  They may have to attend various training classes, workshops, and conferences.  They may have to train and coach new PAC analysts.\r\n",
