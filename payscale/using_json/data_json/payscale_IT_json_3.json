                    "description": "ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) engineers work to design  microchips for specific applications, such as transmission protocols, hand-held computers, and smartphones. Their work is different than that of engineers who work with general integrated circuits, such as microprocessors and random-access memory chips in personal computers. They generally work for companies in electronics, defense, and aerospace, as well as government institutions, and work with architecture, design, implementation, and system integration of a wide variety of integrated circuits.\r\nA bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or a related field is generally required for this position, and some employers may prefer candidates who have master's degrees and/or prior research experience. ASIC engineers who work for technology companies are often required to pass security clearance due to Export Control restrictions related to high-technology products. Many employers also require candidates to be U.S. Citizens or Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States. ASIC engineers may also be responsible for various projects and project management (planning, schedule, budget, cost and scope control, and risk management). They may interact with outside clients in addition to internal clients from other departments of their companies.\r\nASIC engineers work closely with employees of departments such as electrical design, mechanical design, and others which work on the same projects. They must work well in team-oriented environments and maintain confidentiality, and may be required to travel on occasion. Excellent interpersonal skills and oral and written communications skills are highly beneficial.",

Their work is different than that of engineers who work with general integrated circuits, such as microprocessors and random-access memory chips in personal computers. They generally work for companies in electronics, defense, and aerospace, as well as government institutions, and work with architecture, design, implementation, and system integration of a wide variety of integrated circuits.\r\nA bachelor's degree in electrical engineering or a related field is generally required for this position, and some employers may prefer candidates who have master's degrees and/or prior research experience. ASIC engineers who work for technology companies are often required to pass security clearance due to Export Control restrictions related to high-technology products. Many employers also require candidates to be U.S. Citizens or Lawful Permanent Resident of the United States. ASIC engineers may also be responsible for various projects and project management (planning, schedule, budget, cost and scope control, and risk management). They may interact with outside clients in addition to internal clients from other departments of their companies.\r\nASIC engineers work closely with employees of departments such as electrical design, mechanical design, and others which work on the same projects. They must work well in team-oriented environments and maintain confidentiality, and may be required to travel on occasion. Excellent interpersonal skills and oral and written communications skills are highly beneficial.",
