They must ensure that products produced by their company are high quality using automated and manual testing. They need to find and address issues from the networking side of products and make sure that problems are reported as they arise to other relevant staff. Additionally the test/QA engineer for computer networking administers stress and load tests for the networking part of a product. This job is generally full time and is performed in an office setting, which means that long periods of sitting are required. These individuals must work well with other testing and QA personnel, as well as any other individuals involved in the testing process.\r\nCompanies' requirements for test/QA engineers for computer networking may vary. Generally, though, companies require a bachelor's degree in a related field and/or substantial related experience. Experience in a Unix or Linux environment is required by most companies, as is experience with Python, C#, C, C++, JS, PHP, and other types of programming languages. These engineers must also possess strong technical and analytical skills in this position.",
