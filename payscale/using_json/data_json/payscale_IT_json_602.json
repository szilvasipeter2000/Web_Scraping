They must make sure that their system's security and firewall software is up to date, as well as ensure that their employer's computer networks (which may be for their corporate office, regional office and other sites) are operating effectively and efficiently. Technical and network specialists work with various network users on network issues and regularly log system issues and resolutions. They generate reports related to their company's network, which may be presented to their managers or shared with relevant teams. These specialists must stay up to date with technology and other changes within their field, which can include obtaining additional education and attending workshops and conferences. Additionally, technical and network specialists may be required to train and coach new or more junior specialists, as well as travel to vendors' or clients' sites.\r\nEmployers generally require or prefer that their technical and network specialists have at least a bachelor’s degree in information technology, computer science or another relevant field. However, some companies may accept candidates with significant experience in lieu of a degree. Technical and network specialists must be knowledgeable in various networking technologies such as routing, cryptographic tunneling, firewall and switching. They need excellent oral and written communication skills, as well as the ability to work effectively in a team setting. ",
