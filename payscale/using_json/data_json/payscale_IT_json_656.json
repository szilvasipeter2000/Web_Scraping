These managers are responsible for managing a team of developers, engineers and system analysts; this may include on-site and/or remote employees. As a manager, these individuals must effectively delegate tasks, monitor employees' progress, and provide guidance and troubleshooting as needed. Web services managers often oversee budgets for their department as well. \r\nA bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline is generally required for these positions, and a master's degree may be required or preferred. Web services managers also need knowledge of web-related skills such as web development, web design, programming languages and database management. Relevant previous experience is also needed.
