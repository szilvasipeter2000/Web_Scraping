                    "description": "Actuaries are vital to the insurance industry and examine the financial expenses of risk and uncertainty for a business, with a senior actuary further operating jointly with a business' financial leadership to improve or develop new products based on actuarial statistics. Senior actuaries working in the insurance industry usually concentrate in a specific field such as health insurance, life insurance, property insurance and casualty insurance. \r\n\r\nMost senior actuaries work with insurance companies, where they produce policies and decide the amount of a premium that a company should charge for every insurance policy. The senior actuary must make sure that the premiums can make a profit while remaining cost competitive with other insurance company policies on the market. The person in this job uses mathematics, statistics and financial theory to evaluate the prospect that an incident will happen, and assist businesses and clients with developing policies that reduce the cost of that risk. \r\n\r\nSenior actuaries are accountable for and supervise actuaries and actuarial assistants. They also monitor prices and develop technical pricing for the underwriting staff, as well as provide information to senior management. They can also be invited on to testify to public agencies on changes in laws or new laws that concern their business, like state laws fixing caps on auto insurance premiums. \r\n\r\nSome senior actuaries utilize their expertise in financial affairs in companies besides the insurance industry, such as using their knowledge to develop investment approaches that control risk and maximize returns for a company or an individual. Others may assist companies with developing comprehensive policies and procedures that assess risk over all areas of their business in the field of enterprise risk management. \r\n\r\nActuaries require a bachelor’s degree, typically in mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, or another analytical field. A senior actuary job typically requires a master's degree in one of these areas.",

Senior actuaries working in the insurance industry usually concentrate in a specific field such as health insurance, life insurance, property insurance and casualty insurance. \r\n\r\nMost senior actuaries work with insurance companies, where they produce policies and decide the amount of a premium that a company should charge for every insurance policy. The senior actuary must make sure that the premiums can make a profit while remaining cost competitive with other insurance company policies on the market. The person in this job uses mathematics, statistics and financial theory to evaluate the prospect that an incident will happen, and assist businesses and clients with developing policies that reduce the cost of that risk. \r\n\r\nSenior actuaries are accountable for and supervise actuaries and actuarial assistants. They also monitor prices and develop technical pricing for the underwriting staff, as well as provide information to senior management. They can also be invited on to testify to public agencies on changes in laws or new laws that concern their business, like state laws fixing caps on auto insurance premiums. \r\n\r\nSome senior actuaries utilize their expertise in financial affairs in companies besides the insurance industry, such as using their knowledge to develop investment approaches that control risk and maximize returns for a company or an individual. Others may assist companies with developing comprehensive policies and procedures that assess risk over all areas of their business in the field of enterprise risk management. \r\n\r\nActuaries require a bachelor’s degree, typically in mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, or another analytical field. A senior actuary job typically requires a master's degree in one of these areas.",
