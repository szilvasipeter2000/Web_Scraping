While their actions may not be as obvious as those of teachers, they play a large role in helping students gain a strong education.\r\nInstructional technologists can be found in all levels of education, from kindergarten to high school and college, and they are generally responsible for identifying tech-based educational systems applicable to learning, including those pertaining to special education students. They often work closely with school administrations and teachers in determining curriculum by finding, recommending, and sometimes creating technology for classrooms and learning paths. They look closely at past results to help identify problem areas and past successes, fine-tine previous technology implementation, and replace past formats with newer methods to produce stronger results, and they may also train teachers and administrators in using the implemented technologies.\r\nInstructional technologists usually work in an office within a school or administrative building, and they often confer with teachers and administrators on-site, in classrooms, and in different schools. They also travel at times to visit designers of new technology and search for viable systems likely to produce positive results in the schools, so strong verbal and written communication skills are important in this position.\r\nMost instructional technologists have at least a bachelor’s degree, and many also have a master's degree with concentrated studies in curriculum development, classroom support, and other educational topics, as well as computer and IT systems. Depending on their state of employment, they may need certification in their areas of specialty, and they should always stay aware of new developments and styles of education, as they are expected to attend continuing education courses to stay current on their field’s needs.",

While their actions may not be as obvious as those of teachers, they play a large role in helping students gain a strong education.\r\nInstructional technologists can be found in all levels of education, from kindergarten to high school and college, and they are generally responsible for identifying tech-based educational systems applicable to learning, including those pertaining to special education students. They often work closely with school administrations and teachers in determining curriculum by finding, recommending, and sometimes creating technology for classrooms and learning paths. They look closely at past results to help identify problem areas and past successes, fine-tine previous technology implementation, and replace past formats with newer methods to produce stronger results, and they may also train teachers and administrators in using the implemented technologies.\r\nInstructional technologists usually work in an office within a school or administrative building, and they often confer with teachers and administrators on-site, in classrooms, and in different schools. They also travel at times to visit designers of new technology and search for viable systems likely to produce positive results in the schools, so strong verbal and written communication skills are important in this position.\r\nMost instructional technologists have at least a bachelor’s degree, and many also have a master's degree with concentrated studies in curriculum development, classroom support, and other educational topics, as well as computer and IT systems. Depending on their state of employment, they may need certification in their areas of specialty, and they should always stay aware of new developments and styles of education, as they are expected to attend continuing education courses to stay current on their field’s needs.",
