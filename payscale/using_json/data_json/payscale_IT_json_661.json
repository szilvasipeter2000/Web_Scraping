This can include wireless phones, broadband networks and systems, and radio frequency tech. Typically employed by electronics developers  or communication companies, a wireless communication engineer will normally have numerous job hats to wear at various times within these categories.\r\nFor wireless technology companies (such as those developing wireless phones, routers, or modems), most wireless communications engineers will work heavily in research and development, usually as part of a project team. The engineer will typically work to advance new products and designs, as well as improving on the efficiency of existing ones. The wireless communications engineer will find that adherence to deadlines and project milestones is a key to success in this job.\r\nWireless communications engineers are also a key part of a broadband communication company's employment roster. The engineer is likely to be tasked with developing wireless communications systems for large commercial clients. The engineer will typically design a system that produces optimum signal strengths and maximum up-time, as well as speed, security, and efficiency throughout the network. Additionally, the engineer will perform troubleshooting on existing networks and their performance to ensure that it is working as intended at full capacity.\r\nTo work as a wireless communications engineer, a person must typically have a college degree with a computer engineering curriculum. Many employers will also value prior practical experience at lower-level positions in wireless communications technology. Typically, a wireless communications engineer works regular business hours during the week in an office or computer lab environment.",

                    "description": "A wireless communications engineer is a very specialized engineering employee engaged in the research, development, and implementation of all sorts of wireless technologies. This can include wireless phones, broadband networks and systems, and radio frequency tech. Typically employed by electronics developers  or communication companies, a wireless communication engineer will normally have numerous job hats to wear at various times within these categories.\r\nFor wireless technology companies (such as those developing wireless phones, routers, or modems), most wireless communications engineers will work heavily in research and development, usually as part of a project team. The engineer will typically work to advance new products and designs, as well as improving on the efficiency of existing ones. The wireless communications engineer will find that adherence to deadlines and project milestones is a key to success in this job.\r\nWireless communications engineers are also a key part of a broadband communication company's employment roster. The engineer is likely to be tasked with developing wireless communications systems for large commercial clients. The engineer will typically design a system that produces optimum signal strengths and maximum up-time, as well as speed, security, and efficiency throughout the network. Additionally, the engineer will perform troubleshooting on existing networks and their performance to ensure that it is working as intended at full capacity.\r\nTo work as a wireless communications engineer, a person must typically have a college degree with a computer engineering curriculum. Many employers will also value prior practical experience at lower-level positions in wireless communications technology. Typically, a wireless communications engineer works regular business hours during the week in an office or computer lab environment.",
