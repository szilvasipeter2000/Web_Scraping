                    "description": "The information technology (IT) project controller works closely with the project manager, helping create tools to perform financial and project processes, as well as analyzing projects' costs, risks, planning, and accuracy. The IT project controller is responsible for collaborating with the project manager to update and develop projects as well; they are involved throughout the development and update processes, from planning to creating budgets and value adding processes to developing reports that track project process and analyze effectiveness. IT project controllers also plan meetings and documentation for presentations, as well as help create project scheduling to ensure it is aligned with budget restrictions. \r\nThe IT project controller typically works most closely with the project manager, but they also collaborate with many different departments and colleagues within their organization. Therefore, they must be skilled at working with teams and with managers with different leadership styles. This job generally takes place in an office setting, with most of the controller's time spent in front of the computer. Typical employers include large organizations that regularly undertake projects. This role is in the IT field, but it also requires knowledge of finance, budgeting, and risk analysis.\r\nRequired education for IT project controller positions typically includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in a business- or technology-related field, with project management certifications desired. Previous relevant experience - including with budgeting and forecasting - is generally needed as well. IT project controllers must be proficient with basic computer programs such as the Microsoft Office suite, as well as have strong analytical and critical-thinking skills. ",

The IT project controller is responsible for collaborating with the project manager to update and develop projects as well; they are involved throughout the development and update processes, from planning to creating budgets and value adding processes to developing reports that track project process and analyze effectiveness. IT project controllers also plan meetings and documentation for presentations, as well as help create project scheduling to ensure it is aligned with budget restrictions. \r\nThe IT project controller typically works most closely with the project manager, but they also collaborate with many different departments and colleagues within their organization. Therefore, they must be skilled at working with teams and with managers with different leadership styles. This job generally takes place in an office setting, with most of the controller's time spent in front of the computer. Typical employers include large organizations that regularly undertake projects. This role is in the IT field, but it also requires knowledge of finance, budgeting, and risk analysis.\r\nRequired education for IT project controller positions typically includes a bachelorâ€™s degree in a business- or technology-related field, with project management certifications desired. Previous relevant experience - including with budgeting and forecasting - is generally needed as well. IT project controllers must be proficient with basic computer programs such as the Microsoft Office suite, as well as have strong analytical and critical-thinking skills. ",
