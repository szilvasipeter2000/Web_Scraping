       "'Another Masterpiece by Martin Martin sent it out the park again A bit over-long, but one could argue it appropriate. This is t winning DiCaprio any Oscar\\'s, but still a top shelf performance by him, as well as DeNiro. Beautifully shot. There is only one criticism and I will start off at that: I am a person that likes to go for late movies. This is certainly a movie I do not recommend, hence the downgrade in review. Although the detail in movie was great, I would not be surprised if this competed for an Oscars based on the nature of the movie. The movie storyline itself had its uniqueness as I was more informed about the Osage history as well as the abuse their society used to receive. Nevertheless, just because the details and the acting was great, need to consider runtime because this was way too long. The story and the characters develop with tact and credibility in Martin Scorsese\\'s latest film, which reunites the master director with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. It\\'s newcomer Lily Gladstone, however, who steals the spotlight in every scene she\\'s on screen. There\\'s no denying that Killers of the Flower Moon tells a poignant story. Unfortunately, it\\'s written without suspense, intrigue, or mystery, leaving viewers painfully aware of where the plot is going and how the events will eventually unfold. The mediocre dialogue and unnecessarily hefty runtime do the movie no favors, either. There was no legitimate reason for the film to be 3 hours long, so it ended up tedious and drawn out. Nevertheless, it made for a captivating experience to watch a well-made motion picture with stunning set pieces, costumes, and cinematography. Despite the movie\\'s length, I felt interested the whole time. That\\'s a testament to its pacing and compelling story. On top of that, you have tremendous performances by the entire cast...not a single bad performance. I felt as though DeNiro stood out in particular. \\n\\nSet peices were stunning...cinematography was stunning. Certainly a 5/5 experience. Took 4 hours to tell a story that should have taken 90 minutes. As tragic as the history is, the retelling was downright boring. Story of Native American tribe who\\'s people are rich from oil & the people who marry & kill them to profit from their inheritance.\\nDeNiro & DiCaprio both delivery a great performance about love, greed, family.DeNiro may be type cast in roles where he is a greedy criminal out to make a profit for himself, but he plays each role so well it doesn\\'t matter. The shocking true story of love, betrayal, murder, and a conspiracy to kill an entire native american people for their oil wealth. This is not a short film, but I appreciate Martin Scorsese\\'s commitment to realism and the strong acting. Killers of the Flower Moon is TERRIBLE. I do not understand all these rave reviews. A long, boring, disjointed mess with the DUMBEST ending ever. The ending was SO VERY STUPID. The script was awful and DeNiro\\'s character was just a different version of his Goodfellas character.  You could tell when Scorsese was trying so be just SO cinematic with some shots just to try to force emotion, which never worked. It was terrible and anyone who calls it a \"masterpiece\" is simply wrong. Acting, cinematography and wardrobe are exceptional.  Pacing is abysmally slow which renders the film unwatchable for me.  I am going to read the book instead, since it won\\'t take as much of my time and will be more enjoyable.  The editing in for this film is horrendous. A historical movie about scandalous crimes on the Osage that is a reflection of what the US was and is. Today. Money is all America cares and this movie brilliantly portrays it. Absolutely brilliant film! I was completely captivated throughout the entire film. Not since Schindler\\'s List has there been such an important film. The cast, script, cinematography, set design, soundtrack etc. is superb. Stellar performances with everyone involved giving 100%. And don\\'t worry, it doesn\\'t feel too long at all, it\\'s just right. Never a wasted or dull moment. It\\'s a haunting masterpiece that should not be missed. so slow and the plot is terrible. I agree the acting is fine and the directing is good just hated the story. Good story, good acting, but too long and too transparent. herein is over 3 hours of my journey... somewhat ironically, it definitely presents the challenging journey of others, in nearly slow motion... this likely will feel particularly uncomfortable. i respectfully watched everything produced, in its entirety. please find your own opinion. if you\\'re still reading this you might agree to the failure of editing. assuredly, make certain you have have caffeine or alternative, as this feature could induce dozing. An instant classic. Scorsese perfected the movie formula a while ago and this is just another incredible example. If you are up for some slow pace but good performance from the leads its the movie for you. Scorsese missed so many important facts for this story.  Location of the Osage Agency, the BIA offices, plus the courthouse were ALL in Pawhuska, not Fairfax.     These locations are the actual places of several events.    Not including the murders in Fairfax.    \\nBirth of the FBI ??  Outright lie Scorsese!\\nTeddy Roosevelt established the FBI  in 1908.   Look it up.    Also the Million Dollar Elm- That\\'s where millions in lease deals were made.   Again in Pawhuska. \\n\\nI know.  I grew up there. Being of a true event, greed and oppression overshadowing the root of humanity love highlighted the sad reality of life. The movies transparency is much needed.'"
