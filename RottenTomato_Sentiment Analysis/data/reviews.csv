Drama,four_daughters_2023,96,91,"In telling the story of Olfa and her daughters, Ben Hania is also telling the tumultuous story of Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring, a promising movement that began in that country before spreading to the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania (The Man Who Sold His Skin) has fashioned a narrative-docu mix that’s highly ambitious and quite engrossing...There is a lot going on in this quasi-experimental film. And I was always enthralled.  Only with [this experience and] knowledge, as well as the tools to make it work for them, can women Eya and Tayssir's age attempt to finally break the cycle of exploitation and persecution into which they were born. I love this movie, and it might land on my Top Ten list at the end of the year. It is just extraordinary.  A masterful hybrid documentary about sisterhood, motherhood, rebellion, memory, and the agony that thrives with inherited trauma.  The more avant-garde it becomes, the more interesting Four Daughters is. This intriguing documentary mixes fact, recreation of events and family therapy in the story of a Tunisian mother who lost two of her children to jihadists. Arab voices in Western cinemas are all too rare, and “Four Daughters” is one of the best films of the year... Four Daughters is riveting in large part because the charismatic Olfa galvanizes attention. Her dynamism cannot be obscured beneath a funereal head covering.  As the actresses help recreate the life the family had, it turns into a sobering look at parenting, siblinghood, and ingrained patriarchy. Extremely powerful. This is a heartbreaker about mothers and daughters, the cruelty of repression and the slippery but revealing nature of performance. Four Daughters is unlike any film that I’ve seen, documentary or otherwise. Not only has Kaouther Ben Hania crafted an unforgettable work of art with Four Daughters, but she may have also invented a new genre of film. It delves deep into the nature of family bonding and the trauma of separation with an unfailing insight and empathy. [Four Daughers] doesn’t reveal the truth by blurring reality and fiction. Instead, Ben Hania’s film... pieces together memories and emphasizes (rather than minimizes) the effort it takes to reconstruct them. Ben Hania leaves us with much to digest in a film full of heartbreak and joy -- all set against a backdrop of Tunisian political turmoil that led to a rise in religious fervor. ""Four Daughters” is a triumph of layered s","The most compelling documentary of 2023. Stunning filmmaking which brings nuance and personal insights into the dynamics of a single Tunisian mother raising four daughters, two whom go missing. Ce film est absolument brillant. Tant dans la forme que dans le fond. Une réalisation inspirate. Et un témoignage sans égal de la situation des femmes musulmanes en Tunisie. J'ai pleuré, souris, ris.

Drama,the_taste_of_things,98,100,"Although its delectable dishes provide a feast for the eyes — but unfortunately not the stomach — this French period romance is equally nourishing for the brain. ""The Taste of Things"" is about the ""how,"" not the ""what"". You get to know people best by understanding what obsesses them, the activities that interest them. I would be very interested if there might be a “director’s cut” version of the movie that the studio and Mr. Tran considered releasing or seeing the home video release of the film which might include “deleted” or “alternative scene” options. Lingering on the tongue like a sip of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the film leaves one feeling a little drunk, desperately hungry and entirely alive. The dishes are extraordinary, lit like they’re the prized sculptures at a museum, and constantly compounding and complicating themselves. It's a simple but richly observed film in the way these two characters, as well as their understated relationship, come to life by way of the little things.  An engrossing and mesmerizing delight that will nourish your heart, mind and soul. Perhaps one of the most viscerally indulgent films of the year, 'The Taste of Things' is a transfixing culinary triumph. The Taste of Things eloquently speaks the language of love through the art of cooking, and as a viewer, one can't help but be swept away by the warmth of its storytelling The Taste of Things is a stunning ode to food and the people who share it with one another. It’s as beautiful a depiction of the art of cooking as it is of love between its two cooks.

 Juliette Binoche...is simply magical and deserves Oscar consideration...There’s a joy in the love these characters have for food and for each other that washes over you.  THE TASTE OF THINGS is an intimate, exquisite experience. There is no denying that in Hung’s hands food is art. THE TASTE OF THINGS is a movie that begs to be seen a second time because of its intense beauty. And one does not have to possess a high interest in cooking to savor what happens in their kitchen. The film views the love of food and romance as all one singular desire for everything beautiful and fleeting in life. The chemistry between Binoche and Magimel is palpable and sensual, the cinematography is naturalistic, and of course, the film presents us with a series of dishes in the most appetizing and visually attractive way possible. Full review in Spanish. Class, Cuisine And Labor As Aphrodisiac. And the best foreign film this year. While surely a ","This movie is both complex and simple, like a Norwegian omelette. Silences and cooking noises are part of this symphony. I did not watch only this move, I savoured it and felt good about it like after an excellent dinner.  Reminded me of le festin de Babette. Stunning visuals - never seen a movie when food becomes a parallel sensual experience as the love story of the key characters. Pinochet, Magimel and the celebration of food are a much needed hymn to humanity in these dark times. Serenade of culinary scene filled with bountiful stories of romance and a side of gastronomy aspects. With mesmerizing detail of unique cuisine and it's background added more color to the movie. Eugiene and Dodin's relationship also portrays a beautiful poetry of their dynamic-duo translated as the culinary artist that complement each other.","{'Sentiment': 'MIXED', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.006401331629604101, 'Negative': 0.00611607963219285, 'Neutral': 0.0013188545126467943, 'Mixed': 0.9861636757850647}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '671b4ef9-8b2f-4f50-9250-5a5aad84d732', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '671b4ef9-8b2f-4f50-9250-5a5aad84d732', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '162', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:22 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9946322441101074, 'Negative': 0.0014963762369006872, 'Neutral': 0.0037645867560058832, 'Mixed': 0.000106880979728885}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '150a559b-8a08-4be1-b54a-fb4055044553', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '150a559b-8a08-4be1-b54a-fb4055044553', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '166', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:26 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.006401331629604101,0.00611607963219285,0.0013188545126467943,0.9861636757850647,MIXED,0.9946322441101074,0.0014963762369006872,0.0037645867560058832,0.000106880979728885,POSITIVE
Drama,killers_of_the_flower_moon,93,84,"The development of the characters, the performances, the cinematography, and the costume design make this film a true masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish] A depressing cinematic experience that never loses focus despite the long run time. [Full review in Spanish] Scorsese has made a somber, poetic adaptation of David Grann’s account of how a group of greedy white men systematically murdered members of the Osage Nation in early 1920s Oklahoma. Killers of the Flower Moon is the work of a wily old veteran who’s still restlessly searching for new ways to tell stories... and the result is devastating, provocative and profoundly sad, one part emotional gut-punch and one part intellectual argument.  In Martin Scorcese’s telling of the Osage Indian murders, all the violent contradictions of history unfold in domestic intimacy. While Killers of the Flower Moon covers familiar territory for Scorsese, he cedes the floor to the righteous fury of the Osage and other indigenous folks.  It features a fascinating fact-based story, some brilliantly filmed set pieces, and a great ensemble cast with some of America’s finest actors. A largely compelling and engaging cinematic experience Killers rises toward genre horror, and the horror comes from the intimacy of the violence being committed against the Osage... Who is Ernest, really, but a much dimmer, more passive Henry Hill? The subject may seem well-worn—a true-life story of a murder spree—but Scorsese elevates it into a meditation on love, guilt, and what it means to be righteous. Killers of the Flower Moon is as searing an epic as Martin Scorsese has made in his career, and if we don’t take this ending very seriously, we’re going to lose the medium. A killer of historical truth as well. With a seeming connection dropped from the title, 'The Birth Of The FBI' - and the US continuing that not unrelated pseudo-messianic urge, millions in the world slaughtered in that deplorable bid to 'save democracy.' Scorsese’s key interest in this narrative is the criminal machinations of the plot, which is no surprise given his career has almost exclusively been that type of film..Molly is a support character in what should be her story. A love story set amidst a series of murders revealing how indigenous people have been victims of the shadow side of American society -- racism and white supremacy.
 It's not as flashy as some of Scorsese's other films, with fewer expansive set pieces than we often see, but it has a soulfulness and quie","so slow and the plot is terrible. I agree the acting is fine and the directing is good just hated the story. Good story, good acting, but too long and too transparent. herein is over 3 hours of my journey... somewhat ironically, it definitely presents the challenging journey of others, in nearly slow motion... this likely will feel particularly uncomfortable. i respectfully watched everything produced, in its entirety. please find your own opinion. if you're still reading this you might agree to the failure of editing. assuredly, make certain you have have caffeine or alternative, as this feature could induce dozing. An instant classic. Scorsese perfected the movie formula a while ago and this is just another incredible example. If you are up for some slow pace but good performance from the leads its the movie for you. Scorsese missed so many important facts for this story.  Location of the Osage Agency, the BIA offices, plus the courthouse were ALL in Pawhuska, not Fairfax.     These locations are the actual places of several events.    Not including the murders in Fairfax.    
Birth of the FBI ??  Outright lie Scorsese!
Teddy Roosevelt established the FBI  in 1908.   Look it up.    Also the Million Dollar Elm- That's where millions in lease deals were made.   Again in Pawhuska. 

I know.  I grew up there. Being of a true event, greed and oppression overshadowing the root of humanity love highlighted the sad reality of life. The movies transparency is much needed. Depressing yet meaningful movie with great acting by DiCaprio and DeNiro.  At 3h50m with previews, the movie is exceedingly long; you will need to take a few bathroom breaks to see it, but it tells the tale of the robbery and killing of the Osage people with amazing detail.  Almost all the main characters in the movie die or end up in jail, so there is little time for happier side stories.  Unfortunately, the deaths and killings are sprinkled in about every 20-30 minutes, so any suspense there might have been gives way to a sick feeling when yet another one happens.  The story to me was the weakest part with very few positive moments of intimacy between characters; it could have used a little more sex.  On the good side, the scenery was spot on as much of the movie was filmed in Oklahoma, and DiCaprio's Oklahoma accent sounded not only authentic but authentic for that particular time and place.  Overall a well-done movie, though the plot was almost too involved to be filmed. I found this film to","{'Sentiment': 'MIXED', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.27813345193862915, 'Negative': 0.004101346712559462, 'Neutral': 0.017245106399059296, 'Mixed': 0.7005200982093811}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'c9f8503e-af71-433f-a964-1b9c7bbfab1e', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'c9f8503e-af71-433f-a964-1b9c7bbfab1e', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '161', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:22 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.003707371186465025, 'Negative': 0.7216087579727173, 'Neutral': 0.0017367838881909847, 'Mixed': 0.2729470729827881}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '26fcfcbe-df3e-41eb-95e9-edc1ad76abfd', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '26fcfcbe-df3e-41eb-95e9-edc1ad76abfd', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '164', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:26 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.27813345193862915,0.004101346712559462,0.017245106399059296,0.7005200982093811,MIXED,0.003707371186465025,0.7216087579727173,0.0017367838881909847,0.2729470729827881,NEGATIVE
Drama,our_son,89,62,"As a director, Bill Oliver never allows this to be overly melodramatic with blow out, rage fueled fights. Luke Evans and Billy Porter are keen to keep everything as grounded as possible...both give terrific performances. The performances are excellent and despite some moderate contrivances, the compassion for kids and adults alike involved feels more heartfelt than forced. Our Son is a heartfelt drama with strong acting at its core from Luke Evans and Billy Porter. A simple yet engaging melodrama... This is a universal story, made more universal when seen from a different angle. “Sweet” and “sensitive” may win the day. But this fight over “Our Son” is a little bland and predigested A beautifully judged human drama that dissects a dying marriage with humor and intelligence, drawing out an especially open and moving performance from Porter. There’s plenty of lovely little moments here. And while Oliver and Peter Nickowitz’s screenplay plays a tad derivative in places, performances are top-notch.  Nothing gels until the 45-minute mark. That’s when the reality of divorce, separating and child custody issue sinks in... Anger, bitterness, sorrow and longing ensue, and the film finds its footing. A cathartically devastating film, Our Son reaches deep into the wells of emotion, delivering a well-constructed breakdown of love on the shoulders of two actors at the top of their game.  Our Son might get some comparisons to Kramer vs. Kramer because of the many similarities, but Our Son is more like a made-for-TV movie instead of an Oscar-worthy film. The convincing performances elevate this formulaic divorce drama when the pacing drags. Our Son is anchored by two incredibly powerful and heartbreaking performances by Evans and Porter.  “Our Son” deserves to open as many doors for Evans as it does for the character he plays. In Our Son, Luke Evans and Billy Porter deliver stunning performances, but it’s a familiar story we’ve all seen before.

 Porter, in a departure from what we've previously seen him do, unearths the complexities of a rather enigmatic character. Evans is masterful here in a revelatory performance  There’s too little here to distinguish the film from endless other broken-family dramas that have gone before. A universally emotional, deeply personal and wonderfully judged drama that dissects a broken relationship with equal layers of wit and wisdom. Our Son is a reminder that no matter what happens between parents, their children are still important. Our","Totally hot cast! Really heartwarming story and lovely acting. A deeply moving film with excellent performances from the entire ensemble. Highly recommend. Divorce flicks are not my thing but this movie hooked me from the getgo — and it hasn't yet let go. Inspired acting by Billy Porter, Luke Evans first and foremost but a fantastic ensemble cast and that enchanting boy managed to separate me from my beloved popcorn for nearly 2 hours. A beautiful story with fantastic performances from Billy Porter and Luke Evans. Loved it. This movie grabbed me and didn't let go. I felt so deeply for the characters in the film, their story is so beautifully portrayed by Evans and Porter. I highly recommend it but come prepared with some Kleenex--you will need them! Wow. Just wow. What a flick! Stellar cast; great story. Poignant and compelling. Terrific movie. Reminiscent of Kramer vs. Kramer but modernized. The genuine emotions involved makes it a heartfelt and relatable experience. Evans and Porter's performances are truly touching. So, so good.

Drama,priscilla,82,63,"Of all the directors working today, there is no one better suited than Sofia Coppola to make a movie about Priscilla's life with Elvis. Priscilla adds to the distinctive points of view on historical events from a female perspective and, through it, establishes a reflective look at the place of women in society. [Full review in Spanish] So finely attuned to the emotional swell of new relationship infatuation that you can almost hear the water as the wave of excitement recedes and reality sets in. Keeps the myth alive of a virgin and a hillbilly. Coppola has no insight. Maybe it was just a paid gig. It has no director’s vision, point of view, or interpretation. It’s a bore. The genius of Coppola’s film is that it is both knowingly hollow and somehow deeply felt all at once, celebrating female self-ownership and the travails of learning to know oneself. Pretty, muted and, in the end, boring. Priscilla will hold few surprises for Presley-holics. What the film does offer is a dreamlike take on a teenage girl swept off her feet by the Earth’s most famous man. Cailee Spaeny's portrayal of the eponymous character stands out as a career-defining performance, showcasing her remarkable talent and paving the way for a promising future in the industry. While it ultimately feels a bit hollow in what emotions it elicits, Priscilla has an unshakeable immersive quality that still conveys a sentimentality and lovesickness... Priscilla may not work for die-hard Elvis fans, but Coppola applies her visually appealing aesthetic to tell Priscilla’s story regardless of how Elvis is portrayed. This movie drifted away from me. It's more of an aesthetic object than a real biopic.  Who was Priscilla, really, other than a girl obsessed with a larger-than-life star? After 110 minutes of this movie, I'm still not sure, and even though that’s kind of the point, it makes the character portrayal seem like it’s missing something. Sofia Coppola was the perfect person to study Priscilla Presley because she understands how to bring forth the ornate and instantly undercut it with the way she frames it. The story has the impact of a slowly deflating balloon, and it’s almost funny how anticlimactic the ending is. ... This might be intentional – endings in real life can be like that. It doesn’t make the film any better. I think Coppola does well balancing that duality, never shying from the violence or the romance. If anything, she employs that convergence to deliver a compelling biopic that seeks","I read the book and was really excited for this movie but it was a bit of a let down. I know it's not an action film but it wasn't very exciting and I felt bored throughout most of it. Also, I felt like Elvis and Priscilla were just whispering the whole time, and Priscilla in particular barely showed any emotion, even when she was supposed to be really happy. Just wasn't buying their love story and felt like I was watching stiff performances. Jacob did a good job as Elvis but half the time I wanted them to speak up so it took away from his portrayal of him. It wasn't a horrible movie, but I don't think I could ever rewatch it. The film's solid pacing is its best side. Never go down. Cailee Spaeny's cuteness also keeps you going. But movies lack spice. There should be something more dramatic, I guess. Like the movie, but it could have been much better. Two big problems: one, there is no story (so the perfect film for Coppola). Two, after Austin Butler there is no other Elvis. Everything I was afraid it would be. Unless you are really obsessed with the age gap between the two you might want to skip it. I thought it was very dull. The story line could have been a lot better. She barely spoke and this was suppose to be about her life with Elvis. Not a very good movie. We can get a small glimpse into an icons life, but it's an important glimpse. It's very slow moving and you could do with subtitles to understand Elvis the sound is awful and the lighting you will definitely not need a sleeping pill 💊 Great movie. They aged Priscilla really well and really gave her the spotlight as opposed to the Elvis movie with Austin Butler. Jacob also plays a better Elvis than Austin. it was so rotten! poor Lisa Marie that her father was portrayed like that A well performed movie about the life of Priscilla Presley. The girl playing Priscilla was actually prettier than the real Priscilla. Shows his side of Elvis that many didn’t know. Like didn’t know he was a smoker and he took lots of pills. I can't understand how anyone would find this movie enjoyable. ""Well acted"", you've got to be kidding. Maybe Elvis bit the actress playing Priscilla was horrible. The Priscilla Presley biography radiates in the hands of Sofia Coppola, who delivers subtle tenderness between moments of brilliant acting and respectful storytelling.

Drama,oppenheimer_2023,93,91,"Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation. That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages. While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most. I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by Oppenheimer had no voice. Nuclear noir spectator sports, a poison apple metaphorically intimating apocalyptic original sin, bombs, bombshells, and that buried Operation Paper Clip elephant in the room.  Nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling, dynamic fashion. Oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't get at least a few Oscar nominations. A suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career. An intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted biopicture about the kinds of events that are hard on the heart.
 With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous. In a movie about impending global catastrophe, he gives a close-up of a face, and a twitch of a lip the power of an atom bomb. Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time. What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish] His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance... A cinematographic marvel by all measures. [Full review in Spanish] The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come. Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career be","Brilliant cast & acting.  Great screenplay. It does jump around in the timeline so, you need to pay attention Fantastic film chronicling a very interesting time in our history, great performance by Cillian Murphy and great direction by Nolan A disjointed mess of fast paced scenes that mostly last less than seconds on the screen, and yet trying to tell what was a compelling life about a fascinating person and time. It was well intended but this is a story that could have benefited greatly from well developed scenes told in a straightforward manner and not flashback, flash forward, and flash sideward. The man was obviously a brilliant but troubled character with some interesting relationships besides being primarily responsible for a world changing event. Yet none of these paths are ever fully developed and if you blinked in certain scenes you missed the message. What did we learn from the sex scenes with Jean for example - Nothing about anything.  What is with this fast paced, scenes for a second, that directors all of sudden are doing as if because faster it told a better story?  It doesn't. Try watching a brilliant David Lean movie. I was blown away! Pun intended!! Excellent movie It's as if a science documentary was turned into a thriller. Brilliant. Powerful movie. Really gives you a sense of the dilemma that they went thru to built a world destroying bomb. A movie that takes it time to tell a story can be a wonderful thing. This is not. It's is laborious, strangely not engaging and unintelligible at times. Oppenheimer was rich in character development and intelligent, mind candy  dialogue. The three hour length was necessary to tell the complete story, and Im not complaining about it as it flew by. 

I enjoyed it even more on the second viewing it was so full of nuanced dialogue and superb acting. 

Its one of those epic pictures that will stand the test of time. Great movie, sex scenes seemed forced and out of place but still a great movie It was the only time I left the movie theater, before the movie was over! First, did not need to be 3 hours.
Second, too dense dialogue with non/stop talking, even when transitioning between scenes. That, plus the music over the script for almost the entire movie, made it difficult to get into what was being said, and to formulate my own emotional connection throughout narrative. This movie was really good. The humor was good, The cinematography was beautiful , the acting was amazing, and the whole movie was written","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.46611306071281433, 'Negative': 0.05515110492706299, 'Neutral': 0.02446003444492817, 'Mixed': 0.4542757570743561}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '98d582a9-ed99-412d-bd98-602703ac2aec', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '98d582a9-ed99-412d-bd98-602703ac2aec', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '162', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:22 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9966734647750854, 'Negative': 0.0010587609140202403, 'Neutral': 0.00046044192276895046, 'Mixed': 0.0018072931561619043}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'a08a0ee5-5b2c-4175-a87b-27195357095b', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'a08a0ee5-5b2c-4175-a87b-27195357095b', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '168', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:27 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.46611306071281433,0.05515110492706299,0.02446003444492817,0.4542757570743561,POSITIVE,0.9966734647750854,0.0010587609140202403,0.00046044192276895046,0.0018072931561619043,POSITIVE
Drama,napoleon_2023,58,58,"It’s clear, I think, that in spite of various attempts to make Napoleon work as a biopic, the film doesn’t have a bio. It has a general of genius, something like a sports figure who is alive only in games or tournaments. Epic battle scenes but the personal story is lacking. It feels as if Scott is flipping the bird to a film industry that takes itself too seriously. Known for his prowess in historical dramas, Scott's latest endeavor falls short in grasping the complexity of Napoleon's rise and fall. The film is visually impressive, but it is not emotionally stirring. The heart of it was not as exciting as it could be in terms of the emotions. I have mixed feelings on this film.   While there's no immediate lesson to be found in ""Napoleon,"" one might yet be found in director Scott's upcoming 4-hour version. I'd recommend waiting. It’s definitely not your typical portrayal of a famous historical figure, and the better for it. You’re not going to have a complete picture of the events that comprised Napoleon’s life, but you might just have a better understanding of who the man was and why we’re still so fascinated by him over two centuries after his death. I don't want to assume anything yet, but you can't help but wonder given the editing here that this might be another KINGDOM OF HEAVEN situation.  It doesn’t really take a historian to appreciate that a lot of liberty’s have been taken here. Equally, it doesn’t take a psychiatrist to know that Scott barely scratches the surface of Napoleon’s psyche. [Joaquin] Phoenix's penchant for dry, understated performances turns this one into a downright comedy, a Wes Anderson character study trapped in a Steven Spielberg period drama ... Where does Napoleon start when Phoenix never seems to end? War is hell, of course, in Ridley Scott’s biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte. But for viewers of this film, safe in their cinema seats, it is also inescapably magnificent. Napoleon offers so much. And yet it leaves us wanting more. Despite all the history, the battles and the politics, this movie stays on track as a personal story. This makes Napoleon and Josephine characters in the story who are easy to relate to, as well as being a strong focal point for the film. It is fascinating watching Phoenix play Bonaparte like he's a gamer who's constantly on the verge of rage quitting. Ridley Scott's newest film, Napoleon, suffers in its storytelling from the many historical inaccuracies that plague the picture. The mediocrity of the film ","I really enjoyed this movie and think it did a great job at highlighting Napoleon's life without feeling the need to stop at every single detail. While that means it did leave out some things and left other things just unsaid I appreciated the pacing the enjoyed the movie. I do think it would pretty hard to include a lot of battle scenes (which were beautifully shot) and left out some things as a result to get them all into the movie. Overall great movie! Really gruesome, not for light hearted viewers. 85% true to Wikipedia read. Interested in visiting France near future. Vastly underrated. Truly an epic movie—the battle scenes are off the scale. I can't wait for the 4+ hour version!! This movie was so bad it made me created a rotten tomatoes account to warn people not to see it. It should have been called ""Napoleon and Josephine"" or ""Napoleon...Josephines b!÷¢h"". The movie focused on their relationship instead of how the man went from nothing to conquering everything. It completely skipped his time in Italy and how he rose to power. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time; there are no better words I can think of to describe how disappointed I was with this movie. It was a very cinematographically beautiful movie, showing Napoleon as a very smart and fierce general while showing his vulnerability with his love for Josephine. Choppy. It left me feeling flat! The wars were confusing. The conversations were short & didnt explain what was happening. Ridley Scott is amazing, but this story is too big for a movie. I wish he'd made it into a series instead. Like another reviewer said, it feels like a slideshow.  Not up to his usual standards One of the best and most epic historical masterpieces I've ever seen. The acting was incredible. It was surprisingly funny, and I thought the battle scenes were incredible. The only complaint I have is that I think the movie was a little too long, but I highly recommend watching napoleon. It could have been epic but film lacked continuity and never got a sense of the man, story disjointed. Felt rushed and poor personal story development Good movie. Kind of rushed, could’ve used more war I left the movie thinking what was the whole point of it and how do I get my $9 back.

Drama,animal_2023_2,28,81,"Trashy, idiotic, and filled with disgusting bloody violence that's overly repetitive, Animal is excruciatingly too long at 201 minutes. This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal’s terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India’s religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can’t be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked in","Animal movie is the collage of the insta reels put together unimaginably, to ignite the spark within the youth with low IQ and even lower span of attention. But that is what an Indian audience will get, who grew up on Salmanolothic and Govindaesque mindless flicks of 3 hours. What a waste of so much talent, but a much appreciated effort by the post production and marketing team to make this project a monetary success. Amazing movie, 10 out of 10 “The Arab middle easterners are here; the Arabs are here! Can I rate this 0/5?
Mysogynist director and his pathetic script. This movie disgusts me.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga definitely is disturbed in the head to make movies like this one and Kabir Singh LOL. Top notch acting, music, action. Excellent performance by Ranbir and all other co-stars. It has some short comings, but is perfect combination of top class acting, music, action, emotions, family and relationships. Waste of money and time Bollywood has once again proved that it can't parallel Hollywood.

Animal is among the longest movies of the Bollywood, spanning over 3 hours 20 minutes. Yet it's a total waste of time. Even the title has no direct connection with the plot. 

The attempt is to present a deep psychodrama of father son relationship. But the plot is a thorough failure. But no doubt, the performance of Ranbir Kapoor is good and spreads colors on the canvas.

Yet the youth will love this movie as it shows brotherhood and stubborn attitude.

Overall, the film is a tasteless amalgam of action and emotions. It's better to watch some stock drama than to waste time on this fazool film. It makes sex unsexy and for a movie with this budget very shitty editing Absolutely endearing story of a sons love to his father and his family. Must watch for any Bharatiya. I think this movie has a negative impact on society. A little over the top but definitely worth a watch for mature audience. Worst movie ever. That much violence is insane and would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of time. What the f*ck did I watch! First 40 minutes were too abrupt and quickly stitched to try to make a point which wasnt landing. Action sequences were the savior amidst weak acting and characters played by Anil Kapoor. Outstanding Performance by Ranbeer Kapoor !! Unbelievable movie! Too much violence and not family oriented Excellent movie. Love to see the father and son bonding. The greatest movie ever made in Bollywood. Violent but with a strong father-son emotional hook.

This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal’s terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India’s religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can’t be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked in","Animal movie is the collage of the insta reels put together unimaginably, to ignite the spark within the youth with low IQ and even lower span of attention. But that is what an Indian audience will get, who grew up on Salmanolothic and Govindaesque mindless flicks of 3 hours. What a waste of so much talent, but a much appreciated effort by the post production and marketing team to make this project a monetary success. Amazing movie, 10 out of 10 “The Arab middle easterners are here; the Arabs are here! Can I rate this 0/5?
Mysogynist director and his pathetic script. This movie disgusts me.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga definitely is disturbed in the head to make movies like this one and Kabir Singh LOL. Top notch acting, music, action. Excellent performance by Ranbir and all other co-stars. It has some short comings, but is perfect combination of top class acting, music, action, emotions, family and relationships. Waste of money and time Bollywood has once again proved that it can't parallel Hollywood.

Animal is among the longest movies of the Bollywood, spanning over 3 hours 20 minutes. Yet it's a total waste of time. Even the title has no direct connection with the plot. 

The attempt is to present a deep psychodrama of father son relationship. But the plot is a thorough failure. But no doubt, the performance of Ranbir Kapoor is good and spreads colors on the canvas.

Yet the youth will love this movie as it shows brotherhood and stubborn attitude.

Overall, the film is a tasteless amalgam of action and emotions. It's better to watch some stock drama than to waste time on this fazool film. It makes sex unsexy and for a movie with this budget very shitty editing Absolutely endearing story of a sons love to his father and his family. Must watch for any Bharatiya. I think this movie has a negative impact on society. A little over the top but definitely worth a watch for mature audience. Worst movie ever. That much violence is insane and would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of time. What the f*ck did I watch! First 40 minutes were too abrupt and quickly stitched to try to make a point which wasnt landing. Action sequences were the savior amidst weak acting and characters played by Anil Kapoor. Outstanding Performance by Ranbeer Kapoor !! Unbelievable movie! Too much violence and not family oriented Excellent movie. Love to see the father and son bonding. The greatest movie ever made in Bollywood. Violent but with a strong father-son emotional hook.

Depressing, depraved and pretty disgusting Saltburn is wild, dark, disturbing and absolutely delightful, and I really can't explain why I enjoyed this wild ride of a story as much as I did. It's like ‘Succession' meets ‘Rocky Horror.' Plus, the retro song list is a hoot; from T.

Drama,the_holdovers,96,91,"Working from a script from David Hemingson, Payne has crafted a wonderful story of loneliness and isolation that manages to be both inspirational and uplifting.  … you leave the theatre with a renewed sense of what it really means to be human. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is amazing in this as well. The uncommon movie these days that really does earn laughs and tears. A touching drama that infuses acerbic wit with sincere platonic love, convincingly delivered by Giamatti, Randolph, and newcomer Sessa. The comedy is perfectly blended with loneliness, producing a memorable story that can make you laugh and cry. The performances by these three lead actors are all superb, and they had to be in order for this movie to work this well with such a small cast.  Whether it’s putting your money where your mouth is or refusing to stay on the sidelines, people make the right choice if their convictions are true, consequences be damned: the essence of being a Barton man. There are surprises to be found in The Holdovers, but they come from the characters, not the story — from the ways each of the three main figures reveals new depths and confounds expectations. In Payne’s work, one individual’s foibles and failings can open another’s perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director’s greatest films. The way Paul Giamatti tip toes between teacher, paternal figure, friend and even combatant is nothing short of sublime. Hunham’s hero Marcus Aurelius once wrote, “Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing.” Take his advice and see this film. The Holdovers delivers in every way. It is a genuine and heart-warming story with complex characters. Paul Giamatti gives his most memorable performance to date, and this is arguably Payne’s best work.
 There’s something elastic to Giamatti’s performance as Mr. Hunham, particularly in his face: he never lacks a wide-eyed stare or a clenched jaw; it’s a masterpiece of miserly annoyance, he’s the king of put-upon stiffs. The Holdovers, after being stuck in the snow for too much of its more-than-two-hour runtime, does eventually land in an emotionally satisfying place. The best way to describe Payne’s ninth feature is to say it’s remarkably ordinary. A quality that applies to most of his films that are warm, quiet, and inherently funny meditations about unexceptional people leading a simple life. There are so many touching and subtle scenes in this film. So well done.  Alexander Payne has created a","Holdovers is a delightful movie for those who like leave the theater just a little different than when they walked in, with a slightly different perception of life and the values we hold dear.  A thought-provoking movie with layers of messages. The casting is perfect, the storyline is emotionally packed with humor and wit. Loved it! This is one of the best Christmas movies I've seen so far. I thought there were really excellent messages, about family that were really strong, and will probably resonate with most people during the holidays, and I thought the comedy was amazing. I was laughing through the entire movie. The acting was also excellent, and it had the charm of a classic 90s Christmas movie while still modernizing it a little bit. By the end of the film, I was in the Christmas spirit. That's why I recommend putting The Holdovers on your wish list to watch this year. An instant classic. This movies captures a myriad of human emotion: comedy, happiness, jealousy, and heartbreak to name a few. A must watch this holiday season! Loved it!Excellent story, acting and screenplay. Not an Alexander Payne fan but I really loved this movie.  It captures the feel and look of the 70s while exploring themes that resonated then and now.  Excellent acting across the board. It's rare to see a movie just sit with itself anymore. Everything has to be such huge set pieces or some larger than life situation but not here. In many ways this movie is a refreshing throwback to the era I'm which it's set. Just a movie about people being people. I know this isn't going to win any Oscars but it definitely deserves them all the same. Well written. Reminiscent of a good John Irving novel. This generations less-polished, more real Dead Poets Society. Lovely, warm-hearted and lovable. Giamatti as always brings so much more to the show than what he is given on the page. What's here is good you just wish there was a little bit more. Only the teacher and pupil flesh out at all the other characters are 2-dimensional. A strong freshman effort? Or one and done true-to-life tale with nothing else in the creativity tank?  Capture the 70s tone perfectly but too reliant on long close-ups of thoughtfully posed actors.

Comedy,the_holdovers,96,91,"Working from a script from David Hemingson, Payne has crafted a wonderful story of loneliness and isolation that manages to be both inspirational and uplifting.  … you leave the theatre with a renewed sense of what it really means to be human. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is amazing in this as well. The uncommon movie these days that really does earn laughs and tears. A touching drama that infuses acerbic wit with sincere platonic love, convincingly delivered by Giamatti, Randolph, and newcomer Sessa. The comedy is perfectly blended with loneliness, producing a memorable story that can make you laugh and cry. The performances by these three lead actors are all superb, and they had to be in order for this movie to work this well with such a small cast.  Whether it’s putting your money where your mouth is or refusing to stay on the sidelines, people make the right choice if their convictions are true, consequences be damned: the essence of being a Barton man. There are surprises to be found in The Holdovers, but they come from the characters, not the story — from the ways each of the three main figures reveals new depths and confounds expectations. In Payne’s work, one individual’s foibles and failings can open another’s perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director’s greatest films. The way Paul Giamatti tip toes between teacher, paternal figure, friend and even combatant is nothing short of sublime. Hunham’s hero Marcus Aurelius once wrote, “Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing.” Take his advice and see this film. The Holdovers delivers in every way. It is a genuine and heart-warming story with complex characters. Paul Giamatti gives his most memorable performance to date, and this is arguably Payne’s best work.
 There’s something elastic to Giamatti’s performance as Mr. Hunham, particularly in his face: he never lacks a wide-eyed stare or a clenched jaw; it’s a masterpiece of miserly annoyance, he’s the king of put-upon stiffs. The Holdovers, after being stuck in the snow for too much of its more-than-two-hour runtime, does eventually land in an emotionally satisfying place. The best way to describe Payne’s ninth feature is to say it’s remarkably ordinary. A quality that applies to most of his films that are warm, quiet, and inherently funny meditations about unexceptional people leading a simple life. There are so many touching and subtle scenes in this film. So well done.  Alexander Payne has created a","Holdovers is a delightful movie for those who like leave the theater just a little different than when they walked in, with a slightly different perception of life and the values we hold dear.  A thought-provoking movie with layers of messages. The casting is perfect, the storyline is emotionally packed with humor and wit. Loved it! This is one of the best Christmas movies I've seen so far. I thought there were really excellent messages, about family that were really strong, and will probably resonate with most people during the holidays, and I thought the comedy was amazing. I was laughing through the entire movie. The acting was also excellent, and it had the charm of a classic 90s Christmas movie while still modernizing it a little bit. By the end of the film, I was in the Christmas spirit. That's why I recommend putting The Holdovers on your wish list to watch this year. An instant classic. This movies captures a myriad of human emotion: comedy, happiness, jealousy, and heartbreak to name a few. A must watch this holiday season! Loved it!Excellent story, acting and screenplay. Not an Alexander Payne fan but I really loved this movie.  It captures the feel and look of the 70s while exploring themes that resonated then and now.  Excellent acting across the board. It's rare to see a movie just sit with itself anymore. Everything has to be such huge set pieces or some larger than life situation but not here. In many ways this movie is a refreshing throwback to the era I'm which it's set. Just a movie about people being people. I know this isn't going to win any Oscars but it definitely deserves them all the same. Well written. Reminiscent of a good John Irving novel. This generations less-polished, more real Dead Poets Society. Lovely, warm-hearted and lovable. Giamatti as always brings so much more to the show than what he is given on the page. What's here is good you just wish there was a little bit more. Only the teacher and pupil flesh out at all the other characters are 2-dimensional. A strong freshman effort? Or one and done true-to-life tale with nothing else in the creativity tank?  Capture the 70s tone perfectly but too reliant on long close-ups of thoughtfully posed actors.

But also, an exploration of female sexuality, maturity and evil, in the midst of a dark comedy. [Full Review in Spanish] Stone commands each and every scene in which she appears (which is very nearly every scene in the movie), and I strongly suspect that Bella Baxter will go down in the pantheon of unforgettable screen characters. Lanthimos takes the social experiment from his breakthrough film Dogtooth in a more crowd-pleasing and comforting direction. Through it all, Bella claims center stage; and whether she’s acting as an innocent or a sophisticate, Stone has no problem anchoring the chaos. unmatched as a visual experience, not as jolly as Lanthimo’s The Lobster, but exquisite, clever, reasonable, and masterful, whisking us away to new ideas, but be warned, it’s a lot.
 The narrative feels long, but the themes and character growth we're shown are tragic, beautiful, and marvelously gripping. You'll be blown away by the beauty of the visuals, but even more entranced by the magnetism of Stone. If not all parts coalesce into a fully successful whole, the cinematic recipe is still a delectable feast worthy of careful consumption. A confection that delights the more you partake of it.

There is no way to watch Poor Things and not be impressed by the sheer guts of all involved to make such a film. And yet, for all of its outlandishness, it actually has a compelling story to tell, and the ideal actor to inhabit the lead role.

Boundaries pushed quite cleverly for an R rated film. I thought this has been Emma Stone’s strongest and bravest performance. Wanted to walk out after 20 minutes but my wife didn't, so I stayed through 2 hour and 20 minutes.  No redeeming value to this movie.  Big names but a ridiculous plot and probably should have been rated MA.  I recommend that you skip it. Poor Things is a fantastical film bursting with philosophical and cinematic ideas. The acting is sharp and the physicality of Emma Stone's performance is the best I've seen this decade.

The best film of Yorgos Lanthimos's career, with the best performance ever from Emma Stone. A must-see for fans of absurdist comedy from the Greek filmmaker.

Drama,eileen,85,51,"Played by Marin Ireland, [Rita] delivers a monologue more potent in its quiet denunciation of the crimes of the patriarchy and the oppression of women than the highly-touted speech in Barbie. Its mounting horror and outrage will harrow your soul. It looks great, it sounds nice, the performances are solid, but none of the choices feel inspired by character or story. It’s a solid, effectively unsettling psychological thriller that could have used a few narrative tweaks to improve the experience. When the dust settles, we're left with a sordid little yarn that sneakily satirizes the three models of femininity on offer in midcentury America: virgin, vamp and virtuous wife. [Olyroyd and Moshfegh have] transformed Eileen into the blackest of black comedies, to the benefit of all involved, especially for their two leads, Thomasin McKenzie and Anne Hathaway, who seize the moment by offering contrasting styles of camp. Eileen looks more forward than inward at the plot hijinks caused by playing God with traumatized people. Still, dimensionality be damned, there are worst sins than taking a wild left turn in a character study. Just when you think you know where this film is going, Rebecca drops a line that abruptly changes the direction of the plot, and the film becomes something very different. It’s a delicious WTF moment that is seldom pulled off with such impact. Eileen is a perverse delight about obsession and cruelty; William Oldroyd’s second feature is the follow up Lady Macbeth deserved. The character development and world-building are detailed and engaging, but the film is rushed at the end, creating an abrupt and stunted resolution that’s inconsistent with what came before. Anne Hathaway gives a completely delicious and wild performance in this original psycho thriller that will make your jaw drop.  Acrid erotic compulsion in [a] most peculiar pulp psychological thriller,... The needling noir, taking up class and matters carceral, is by Ottessa Moshfegh and her husband Luke Goebel. The first part of the movie is a slow-moving, uncomfortable character study. The story picks up steam with the combustible relationship between Rebecca and Eileen, and it really explodes in their confrontation with Rita Polk. Eileen is stiffness and discomfort as the movie feels like a powder keg of potential havoc. Oldroyd succeeds for much of the film before allowing it to crash and burn during a ridiculous third act in which credulity is casually tossed aside in favor of over-a","Great acting and engaging story line. I enjoyed it until the ending like so many other reviews have mentioned. This movie was at least carrying itself through an unsettling story line to just completely ruin it with a non-ending end. Acting and casting are great, very believable. But the ending is not. Proper story, effing ripping and a jolly good time WOT What I liked about the film was that it was so uncompromisingly real. It was a decent and surprising film with a very good cast and first rate acting. it wasn't predictable, and it wasn't trying to please. Given the nature of the two lead characters- the story played out in a way that was very realistic. I might have wished for a neater ending, and I am glad the director had the nerve not to give it to me. The film may not be for everyone, but it stayed with me for sure.  As good as Thomasin, Hathaway and Wigham are in it, Marin Ireland does a scene that is both powerful and sad. Worth seeing. Disappointed because it ended ""open end"",  Great acting, but there really was no ending...so she did the deed, but if there is no sequel to this movie I will be very upset, cuz I want to know HOW ON EARTH SHE WILL (OR WON'T) GET AWAY WITH IT....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DR./IF SHE GOES BACK TO WORK AT SAME JAIL, HOW WILL SHE EXPLAIN IF CALLED AS A WITNESS AT A TRIAL, WHICH WILL SURLEY NEED TO HAPPEN THE CAR WILL BE ID'd, SO WILL EILEEN CONVINCE PEOPLE HER FATHER WAS DRIVING IT AND ""DID THE DEED""?  ALL THIS NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED ONTO A SEQUEL.  THIS MOVIE HAS LEFT ME HANGING. A great noir thriller. Loved it. You may think you know where this Hitchcockian thriller is going, but you don't. When the movie ends, you feel as if it should be just beginning. For a split second you say to yourself, ""what?"" Then, since you're smart, you get it. Artistic brilliance, from the acting, to the writing, cinematography, as well as musical score. There are so many layers to the movie…..it hung with me for days as I unpeeled the experience. The movie requires a sophisticated audience….not the normal pablum produced by the Hollywood corporate machinery. The casting is top notch.  Marin Ireland's one meaningful scene is chilling.  The plot is solid through the first half of the movie and there is an interesting twist towards the end but the conclusion is very abrupt and unsatisfying. Eileen starts off slow and measured perfectly and a bit tense, and right off the bat you know this is going to be an interesting movie.

Drama,dream_scenario,92,68,"I still had fun with the film; it just crashed into a brick wall right when it seemed like it was hitting its stride and preparing to deliver the punch-line. DREAM SCENARIO features a compelling concept that at times is really intriguing, but sadly it's often at odds with the film's commentary on pop culture fads. It's a cunning take on media, both social and traditional, as well as pop culture. Director Kristoffer Borgli avoids tarting up his film with flashy CGI, schtick or an overly imposing score. He stands back and lets Cage do his brilliant best. … an engaging enough experience while it’s happening, but one that you’ll likely have trouble recalling when you wake up the next morning. Cage’s is a tremendous performance that anchors a very good film, a bitter pill chased with a tart cider. …isn’t an entirely satisfying film, struggling to balance media satire with an intense personal journey  but Cage’s memorably agonising performance makes it worth hearing out for anyone concerned about the shallow direction of today’s online discourse… While some of these threads are incompletely developed and others dropped entirely, Dream Scenario never collapses in formless entropy thanks in large part to Cage's open-hearted embrace of his character. ...doesn’t quite know where to go with its high concept. Thematically, Dream Scenario perhaps poses more questions than it is able to effectively answer. Nicolas Cage delivers a wonderful performance in “Dream Scenario,” a quirky dark comedy with fantasy and horror elements. This is only writer/director Borgli’s second feature after numerous shorts; he’s clearly a talent to watch for. Part social commentary on instant fame and fast celebrities, Dream Scenario is a wild ride of The Floor is Lava, where the floor is everyday life and the lava is an incessant 24-hour news cycle supplemented by quick-hit socials like Reels and TikTok. An edgy satire about modern celebrity that, as happens so often nowadays, stumbles toward the close but offers so much that’s good along the way that you forgive its third-act lapses. The good certainly includes Cage’s witty performance.   Dream Scenario takes a cautionary look at celebrity and cancel culture as it traces the fantastical plight of a nondescript, bespectacled, bald and bearded biology professor named Paul, hilariously brought to life by Nicolas Cage. Dream Scenario is worth watching for its clever premise alone, and the casting of Cage is inspired. The first act is the stronge","I think this is a critics movie. One that makes you think just enough to seem profound, but really just tries to hard in the end. Speaking of the end I think this movie would have received maybe one more star if the ending was not so terrible. Overall, it is the odd movie that I am glad I saw but would probably not recommend to others. Nicolas Cage and A24 was not the Dream I thought it would be I suppose using Nicolas Cage’s name will draw/lure an audience? Nicolas Cage really shines in this movie where he can easily share all the torments, flaws and awkwardness of his character while going more crazy in the dream sequence. The premise is so creative and offers great opportunity to play with drama, humor, surrealism and horror. 

Despite all of this, the movie fell flat here and there. It's mostly due to long scenes that while very funny at first stretches the joke to a boring point. The story doesn't take full advantage of its surrealist premise most of the dream lack imaginative visuals that you would expect from it. 

It's important to know that this movie is mostly an allegory about cancel culture but in the case when the victim who loose everything is not guilty of what he is accusing of. It shows how difficult you can apologize for something that you didn't do but still ruin your reputation and your life. It is an interesting and tricky point of view but this focus slows down the movie that should a use more of visual creativity and let us suffering with a character that just being unfairly hated without any chance to recover. It's a good take on not only the real life lore behind a man who was frequently popping up in dreams, but also how some of us feel so unseen and unheard in life and how that desire can go awry. 


The main character is pretty passive and bland, so when he finds out he's the exact way in dreams, it's deeply upsetting to him. He longs to be exciting, memorable, an active member of these dreams... then he meets the one exception to this, which is where the film takes a darker turn. There are many different meanings to this film (as with all art) and I find myself engaging with all of my thoughts of it. 
Recommended watch. Made me think. Made me feel for all the characters.  Great movie to talk about afterwards. Not the Nick Cage I grew up with, so glad he made this movie. Very A24. Not super dark.

Drama,the_oath_2023,25,88,"The Oath is a faith-based movie about Judeo-Christian historical people, but this tedious drama is actually very soulless. The characters, story, and filmmaking are woefully generic, while the acting performances are dismally substandard. There are some well done elements throughout the film, but there are also moments where things collapse from the pressure. At various points resembling “Gladiator,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” and “Braveheart,” “The Oath” mixes elements of drama, action, romance, and fantasy to stirring effect. I appreciate the filmmakers' intentions, but pledging to watch 'The Oath' may cause severe regrets. It's certainly no sillier in any way that I could see than, say, Conan the Barbarian or the Lord of the Rings flicks. And it's at least as heartfelt. The fact that in terms of subject matter this is an unusual film doesn’t mean it’s a good one... it’s solemn, repetitive and unexciting.  Clunky, dull and undercooked while very low on thrills, suspense and emotional depth.  A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian “Last of the Mohicans” action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism’s foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","The music and scenic shots were great. The acting was solid. Costumes and makeup looked incredibly legit. There were touching spots in the story despite sometimes moving a little slow. I hope to see more films like this made. I felt the creators tried very hard to give the film an epic feel this history deserves. That's hard to get across without explaining a little more of the history. I started to feel that more at the end of the movie but might have helped people understand if more history/substance was given in the beginning. Please keep making these! The Oath tells a compelling story with ambitious cinematography, minimal dialogue, and a simple plot. Job well done capturing the solitude of a man without community and his reintroduction to human interaction. The acting is subtle, with good character development throughout. What I appreciate most about Mr. Scott's writing, directing, and acting is the deep reverence for life shown. Where many films today explore the relativity of good and evil, Scott draws a useful line in The Oath: evil is to treat life cheaply and good is to hold life sacred. What's more, this demarcation rings true. Scott's invitation to viewers to hold human life and relationships sacred is a vitally important one. Peace can fill our lives and the world when individuals, families, communities respect life, extend forgiveness, seek reconciliation, and promote the good of the whole human family. I wish more mainstream media exhibited such vision and used its power for good. Bravo Scott and team for your bold commitment to sharing good and promoting peace. Wife and I thought it was amazing. The story was moving and portrayed the struggle of choice and consequences and the meaning of keeping true to your word.  The music was moving as was the breathtaking cinematography.  Highly recommend seeing this movie. I am so glad I decided to watch this movie.  The visuals throughout the movie were a feast for the eyes. The music score was amazing. The story was awe inspiring. I highly recommend watching this movie. You will leave the theater feeling better than when you arrived. -FREEDOM!- So cool to see Moroni come to life. It makes me put myself in his shoes and wonder if I could be like him. It is filmed in such a beautiful place.

A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian “Last of the Mohicans” action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism’s foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","The music and scenic shots were great. The acting was solid. Costumes and makeup looked incredibly legit. There were touching spots in the story despite sometimes moving a little slow. I hope to see more films like this made. I felt the creators tried very hard to give the film an epic feel this history deserves. That's hard to get across without explaining a little more of the history. I started to feel that more at the end of the movie but might have helped people understand if more history/substance was given in the beginning. Please keep making these! The Oath tells a compelling story with ambitious cinematography, minimal dialogue, and a simple plot. Job well done capturing the solitude of a man without community and his reintroduction to human interaction. The acting is subtle, with good character development throughout. What I appreciate most about Mr. Scott's writing, directing, and acting is the deep reverence for life shown. Where many films today explore the relativity of good and evil, Scott draws a useful line in The Oath: evil is to treat life cheaply and good is to hold life sacred. What's more, this demarcation rings true. Scott's invitation to viewers to hold human life and relationships sacred is a vitally important one. Peace can fill our lives and the world when individuals, families, communities respect life, extend forgiveness, seek reconciliation, and promote the good of the whole human family. I wish more mainstream media exhibited such vision and used its power for good. Bravo Scott and team for your bold commitment to sharing good and promoting peace. Wife and I thought it was amazing. The story was moving and portrayed the struggle of choice and consequences and the meaning of keeping true to your word.  The music was moving as was the breathtaking cinematography.  Highly recommend seeing this movie. I am so glad I decided to watch this movie.  The visuals throughout the movie were a feast for the eyes. The music score was amazing. The story was awe inspiring. I highly recommend watching this movie. You will leave the theater feeling better than when you arrived. -FREEDOM!- So cool to see Moroni come to life. It makes me put myself in his shoes and wonder if I could be like him. It is filmed in such a beautiful place.
Loved it This movie was incredibly well cast.  The cinematography was superb, and storyline was simply inspiring.  Darin Scott is a genius storyteller and even better actor. It was good.

Drama,radical,94,99,"The film raises questions about various aspects within the field of education, urging us to reflect on the potential that each person carries within themselves, and the importance of discovering and implementing it. [Full review in Spanish] A perfect example of what a skillful, talented filmmaker, working from a sturdy script, a granular-specific setting... can do to elevate that formula into something altogether memorable and moving. Whether in a starring role or a supporting role Eugnio Derbez is always fascinating to watch. His role as an innovative teacher in this film is one of his best. The heart-warming true story is inspirational and relevant, and Eugenio Derbez delivers a powerful performance.

 ""...hardly radical filmmaking. But like teaching, if it reaches just one struggling student or one burned-out teacher, the film argues, it could well change the world."" They've had two hours in this slow, formulaic and manipulative film to make their point. But as much slack as we cut them for their sweet, well-intentioned ""hearts are in the right place"" effort, they don't quite manage it. Radical tells an impactful story about how inspiration can be found in unorthodox ways. Credible performances elevate this drama, which is based on real people — even when there's a familiar formula about a charismatic teacher who changes students' lives. The students are not child actors plucked from agencies, but genuine locals. Derbez’s interactions are thus charged with a special enthusiasm. Everyone feels real, because they are, and we genuinely feel for everyone involved. We should embrace Radical’s humanistic approach, which focuses on overriding negative stereotypes and outlooks. The result is a story that’s beautifully moving. Thanks to credible child actors and a not-so-funny Eugenio Derbez, the true story of Sergio Juárez Correa precisely reaches our hearts. [Full review in Spanish] Radical is a feel-good movie that earns its uplift, rather than force-feeding the desired emotional responses. Viewers' attention is held throughout by a story that combines funny moments with very touching ones. Eugenio Derbez offers his best work yet in this inspiring and wonderful true story film. [Full review in Spanish] You’ve seen this movie before; you probably won’t mind seeing it again. Eugenio Derbez is simply extraordinary in the lead role. A familiar crowd-pleaser told through a fresh cultural lens, this uplifting drama makes the grade despite adhering to narrative form","Totally Radical dudes Absolutely the best movie for 2023 to watch. I took my 87-year-old mom with my sister to see this movie. My mom was laughing, crying, and laughing again. A must-see movie. Go see it, you'll love it as much as we did, or maybe more. Good movie but Eugenio Derbez is just a clown, it would have been much better with another actor. Excellent film. Everyone should see this at least once. Very inspiring movie but I did notice an error when Paloma saw the SpaceX rocket through the telescope in 2012 but Elon actually decided on Boca Chica as the launch pad in 2014. Inspiring and real - every educator need a to see this movie Great movie. Love it. Very touching movie. BITCOIN RECOVERY MADE EASY BY LOST RECOVERY MASTERS

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did. I was so moved during and after the movie that I consider a total success.  Excellent movie! It was an inspirational story that makes you reflect in the opportunities we already have. muy interesante con la realidad en México  con la enseñanza educacional y la pobreza y pocos maestros que les importen los alumnos y que aprendan Moving, heartwarming, inspirational! Terrific! Such an inspirational movie with great performances, especially all the kids! Es una película que cae en el exceso de exagerar y obviar muchas situaciones. La actuación de Eugenio es bastante mala. Solid performances including those playing 6th graders coping with poverty, corruption, and fragile families. Vitality of Derbez's Sergio as he works to revive his own hope and the potential of his kids, while also managing suspicion and opposition. This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.

Scrapper director Charlotte Regan, who hails from this working-class London milieu, effortlessly captures how the community wildly crisscrosses in the shared spaces around their pastel, candy-colored flats. Director Charlotte Regan handles these matters with a candy-colored levity that can quite often be charming, in a whimsical, Wes Anderson way, but sometimes just plain baffling.

Drama,fallen_leaves,98,79,"There is a Kaursimäki wonderland. He finds it in those unpromising, frosty, ashtray-littered locations. Fallen Leaves is one of the most wondrous of his films, and one of the simplest.  Pöysti delivers a small wonder of a performance, and turns her Ansa into a graceful symbol of survival. The filmmaking mimics the characters’ stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. In Kaurismäki's world, love (and of course, friendship) are the default solutions to survive a gray life, a mediocre job, and an inferior salary. [Full review in Spanish] Fallen Leaves delivers a lot in a short time. It's a story that finds a warm glow in an unlike;ly setting.  Kaurismäki’s latest sees him once again melding deadpan drama, pinpoint humor, and warm humanism into something refreshingly classical and true to his form. Faced with a bruised and battered world, Fallen Leaves merely soothes it, and that’s enough; of all the movies released in 2023, it’s the one with the most humane, satisfying ache. Pöysti is pitch-perfect throughout as a careworn woman with poetry deep down, as Ibsen said of Hedda Gabler.  The film has everything you would expect from the Finnish ironist: cool movie posters and retro pop ballads about love and heartache drifting out against a post-industrial backdrop of foundries and forklifts... Fallen Leaves runs for 82 perfect minutes, which in an era of overblown epics that numb your posterior, makes it a total joy.  With its droll, deadpan humour and poignant central story of two lonely souls connecting, it’s the closest Kaurismäki gets to a feelgood movie (albeit a feelgood movie with incipient liver failure). The twists and turns of Fallen Leaves aren’t so out of the ordinary, but they’re so exaggerated by the perplexity of its main characters as to constantly invite big laughs and unsure snickers in equal measure.

 'Fallen Leaves' feels just right, as if the universe itself had a deadpan sense of humor, playing a teasing game with the lovers.  Kaurismäki’s film manages a rare feat -- to be simultaneously touching and ironic. DROLL, sentimental, and quietly funny, this tale of two everyday Finns and their prosaic love story can’t fail to raise a smile. It’s a slight but captivating film, played with deadpan wit by Poysti and Vatanen. It’s a quiet, sweet, witty, moving Finnish-language drama about a relationship that slo","Kaurismaki with the same formula, same type of story, same type of characters, same type of dialogue and situations, same type of atmosphere.... And even then, it feels refreshing every time. It doesn't get tired. It always works. A delightful cinema Short: perfectly mellow.
Long: Hi. I hope and trust you're well. 
So this film is not true. But what it does do, is to make time, to focus on different acting techniques.
What happens? Un-spoiler alert. I'm still not sure, but I feel it is generally understood? that if one sees a lot of a character, that that character narrates the piece? Boy meets girl.
Opinion pls.
- With no real wish to make everything about my pet theory, this film is fine... 
-but the timing of it sort of makes it part of the fetish of Christmas...
-and so, that it is in Finnish, could be seen/ or heard as - Winter! brings to mind... the people of North Europe! 
-who are not Teddy's bears.
-Also. Thank you.
PS. So I had an experience, when I went along and spoke with someone- and the penny just dropped that whereas I'd spent my formative years at the cinema, he'd been doing some form of work. So. People just don't pick up my references. So this throws me into a quandary ... I think you have got to beware, that too many in-jokes spoil the universality of a piece. meaning, here- call the dog Chaplin, the couple's first dates are at an art-house cinema... That may well be a world the director feels comfortable in. (but if these characters are everymen everywomen everyperson, then not everyone goes to the cinema.) I loved the  deadpan humor in this film, along with the two quirky characters who just can't seem to stay employed. A strong undercurrent of barely expressed emotion and need for connection. It's visually gorgeous, every frame a treasure. It's not much of a secret that the worldview of Finnish society can be more than a little bleak. At the same time, though, it also possesses an understatedly campy, eminently whimsical quality that comes in stark contrast to this otherwise-dour outlook.

Comedy,fallen_leaves,98,79,"There is a Kaursimäki wonderland. He finds it in those unpromising, frosty, ashtray-littered locations. Fallen Leaves is one of the most wondrous of his films, and one of the simplest.  Pöysti delivers a small wonder of a performance, and turns her Ansa into a graceful symbol of survival. The filmmaking mimics the characters’ stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. In Kaurismäki's world, love (and of course, friendship) are the default solutions to survive a gray life, a mediocre job, and an inferior salary. [Full review in Spanish] Fallen Leaves delivers a lot in a short time. It's a story that finds a warm glow in an unlike;ly setting.  Kaurismäki’s latest sees him once again melding deadpan drama, pinpoint humor, and warm humanism into something refreshingly classical and true to his form. Faced with a bruised and battered world, Fallen Leaves merely soothes it, and that’s enough; of all the movies released in 2023, it’s the one with the most humane, satisfying ache. Pöysti is pitch-perfect throughout as a careworn woman with poetry deep down, as Ibsen said of Hedda Gabler.  The film has everything you would expect from the Finnish ironist: cool movie posters and retro pop ballads about love and heartache drifting out against a post-industrial backdrop of foundries and forklifts... Fallen Leaves runs for 82 perfect minutes, which in an era of overblown epics that numb your posterior, makes it a total joy.  With its droll, deadpan humour and poignant central story of two lonely souls connecting, it’s the closest Kaurismäki gets to a feelgood movie (albeit a feelgood movie with incipient liver failure). The twists and turns of Fallen Leaves aren’t so out of the ordinary, but they’re so exaggerated by the perplexity of its main characters as to constantly invite big laughs and unsure snickers in equal measure.

 'Fallen Leaves' feels just right, as if the universe itself had a deadpan sense of humor, playing a teasing game with the lovers.  Kaurismäki’s film manages a rare feat -- to be simultaneously touching and ironic. DROLL, sentimental, and quietly funny, this tale of two everyday Finns and their prosaic love story can’t fail to raise a smile. It’s a slight but captivating film, played with deadpan wit by Poysti and Vatanen. It’s a quiet, sweet, witty, moving Finnish-language drama about a relationship that slo","Kaurismaki with the same formula, same type of story, same type of characters, same type of dialogue and situations, same type of atmosphere.... And even then, it feels refreshing every time. It doesn't get tired. It always works. A delightful cinema Short: perfectly mellow.
Long: Hi. I hope and trust you're well. 
So this film is not true. But what it does do, is to make time, to focus on different acting techniques.
What happens? Un-spoiler alert. I'm still not sure, but I feel it is generally understood? that if one sees a lot of a character, that that character narrates the piece? Boy meets girl.
Opinion pls.
- With no real wish to make everything about my pet theory, this film is fine... 
-but the timing of it sort of makes it part of the fetish of Christmas...
-and so, that it is in Finnish, could be seen/ or heard as - Winter! brings to mind... the people of North Europe! 
-who are not Teddy's bears.
-Also. Thank you.
PS. So I had an experience, when I went along and spoke with someone- and the penny just dropped that whereas I'd spent my formative years at the cinema, he'd been doing some form of work. So. People just don't pick up my references. So this throws me into a quandary ... I think you have got to beware, that too many in-jokes spoil the universality of a piece. meaning, here- call the dog Chaplin, the couple's first dates are at an art-house cinema... That may well be a world the director feels comfortable in. (but if these characters are everymen everywomen everyperson, then not everyone goes to the cinema.) I loved the  deadpan humor in this film, along with the two quirky characters who just can't seem to stay employed. A strong undercurrent of barely expressed emotion and need for connection. It's visually gorgeous, every frame a treasure. It's not much of a secret that the worldview of Finnish society can be more than a little bleak. At the same time, though, it also possesses an understatedly campy, eminently whimsical quality that comes in stark contrast to this otherwise-dour outlook.

Drama,the_marsh_kings_daughter,37,73,"The movie could have been a meaningful study of trauma. Instead, it gives in to the mechanics of a cat-and-mouse pursuit. For a while, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” feels as though it may be heading somewhere truly interesting, but, instead, it becomes a bit waterlogged. I was sitting back in my seat, nowhere near the edge of it. I would have liked to have inched towards the edge of it.  This is a very suspenseful film, at times unpleasantly so.  It's ironic that much of The Marsh King's Daughter takes place in a backwoods marsh area, because this entire movie is a soggy mess. It starts off as a monotonous drama and devolves into a series of silly action scenes that don't look believable. Ridley feels challenged in the right ways, while Mendelsohn channels another scummy character to strong effect. The stakes are just high enough to have kept me involved, and that’s fine for a decent paperback come-to-life situation. There’s nothing especially surprising about the way the film wraps up, but it still packs a mild punch, thanks to Ridley’s cold stare, borne of childhood trauma. A potent premise and earnest performances from Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are let down by an under-written screenplay that submits to the temptations of its genre. The tale is too tame, its savagery held too much in check to truly hold the audience in its thrall. It might make for a better book but The Marsh King’s Daughter is a stiff and stuffy thriller, lacking in a tighter script, and any true energy to dig itself out of the mud. While the premise of The Marsh King's Daughter is rich with the possibility for how introspectively deep the story could go, it doesn't manage to get there.  Rather than keeping us guessing or catching us by surprise, the movie goes the more conventional route, leading to an ending that's as far-fetched as it is predictable.  After a promising opening, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” quickly falls into a predictable and monotonous slog, plodding along toward an inevitable confrontation between father and daughter. On the positive side, the acting is good and the atmospheric setting is visually pleasing. Carried by a solid cast, The Marsh King’s Daughter tackles its intriguing premise in a competent fashion but never rises above the level of Lifetime thriller.
 For a thriller to work, you have to guess what's gonna happen, but the minute he [Mendelsohn] escapes from prison you just know exactly what's going to happen. This is a formulaic, predictable thrille","'The Marsh King's Daughter' is an unfulfilling thriller that drowns in predictability and plodding. Good slow burner, enjoyable without being over the top. When a young girl learns that her life has been a lie, she grows up and puts to use the skills her father gave her in an attempt to save her new family The premise of a daddy's girl finding out that her mom was kidnapped and her woodsy life had been a lie is a great one. And when Mendelsohn comes back for her and her family years later, he's the perfect foe. But, the tension that could've been, just wasn't. Fantastic. Daisy is amazing. Fun suspense Thriller! My wife and I LOVED the movie! I'm absolutely dumbstruck by the number of negative reviews from the pros. The movie kept us on the verge of our seats most of the time. The plot was real, actors amazing (especially the two main characters), music on the money. We highly recommend it! A very engaging and hypnotic thriller. Neil Burger brings Karen Dionne's best-selling book to life through the great writing of Mark L. Smith and his daughter Elle Smith who together adapted this complex father daughter relationship. Daisy Ridley really comes into her own as one of our greatest actors and gives a powerful performance! Nearly a 40% difference from ""Critics"" to the average person.  Who even needs ""critics"" anyway. Dull and uninspiring. The cast isn't great either and there's just not much here to enjoy.  Times the story could have taken chances they just pushed through it. A trend a lot of modern writing has, bad. Gostei, tô querendo assistir esse filme! Gostei muito. Filme que prende você até o final Don't pay money to watch this. In fact, don't even watch it if someone pays you to. The premise is great but then it's absolutely trashed by a horrific plot progression that leads to one of the most unsatisfying conclusions imaginable. A filha do rei do pântano é uma excelente opção de vídeo para um final de semana. 👏🏽 Esse filme é muito bom Simplesmente perfeito A história não empolga, arrastando-se a partir do meio. Não há dúvida que a proposta era um trilhar que prende a atenção do telespectador, porém não cumpriu o que prometeu. Extremely bad pacing, I don't know if it's the director or editor. The acting wasn't very good either but I admit I watched this after a week of acclaimed films, so this movie paled in comparison. Garret Hedlund was good though. I wish he had more roles! Muito bom, excelente Interessante, recomendo.

Drama,the_road_dance,81,94,"A serendipity of a movie with twists and turns I absolutely did not see coming. Essentially a period tearjerker about a woman’s resilience in the face of tragedy, but an evocative, emotionally effective one, anchored by a powerful lead performance by Hermione Corfield.  A small beauty, old-fashioned in emotion and technique, a pocket epic shot in the 4:3 Academy ratio of the earliest feature films. The storytelling is old-fashioned, but its raptures dear; the landscapes are timeless. Hopeful, it sweeps, even soars. Carrying most of the burden is Corfield, who is outstanding.  The actor channels Kirsty’s despair in a way that cuts straight to your heart. You simply can’t take your eyes off her, her conviction in the role a force to be reckoned with.  We’re left with the pretty scenery and a free-floating sense of inconsequentiality. Scottish Gothic-romantic entry boasts fine lead turn by Hermione Corfield and sweeping novelistic detail. Strong performances and striking visuals elevate this true-life Scottish melodrama above its narrative conventions. ... committed acting performances, particularly by the primary trio of Corfield, Morven Christie, and Ali Fumiko Whitney (the latter as Kirsty’s mother and sister), elevate this film far beyond what the rather mundane scripting gives them to work with. An old-fashioned melodrama, The Road Dance isn't quite up to the task of tackling the severity of the traumatic event at its core. The result has neither the full force of realism nor the emotional pleasures of melodrama; what it most calls to mind is something seen and half-forgotten on PBS. A vividly rendered, if ultimately schematic portrait of feminine resilience. “The Road Dance” is well worth a turn on the dance floor, delivering nicely on the time you invest in these characters and their situation. However, what unfolds in The Road Dance is an engaging, beautifully filmed, and intimately acted tale of trauma, grief, resilience, and hope. The commanding sense of place is most memorable in this naturalistic story of female bonding, a sweeping, sensitive melodrama about the consequences of a single violent act in a remote community … a handsome production that is striving for an emotionality that it cannot deliver because it fails to utterly commit to the protagonist. Photographed in the old-fashioned pre-wide-screen 3 x 4 ratio, the film is simple but, in its small way, quite memorable. The Road Dance is elevated by the simply stunning turns of both Fletcher","A gripping drama set in the pre WW1 period where young men and women were facing many terrors of war.  Entwined in that setting is a poignant story of a lovely young lady, in the prime of life, struck by love then loss.  The story was gripping.  The theme relates to many social questions today.  Not just a chick flick...I am an old man and enjoyed the movie tremendously. Beautiful film of love and tragedy in a small village in Scotland during the First World War. A must see for anyone who loves period films.  Stunning scenery and acting under the direction of Richie Adams. Very sad but ended very good. Great movie. There is no doubt... THE ROAD DANCE by Richie Adams is an instant cinema masterpiece! My wife and I laughed, cried, and mourned along with the characters as we sat spellbound by the finely tuned, smoothly unfolding epic story. Financers should be lining up to back Richie Adams next film! Clint and Lisa McCowen This movie was wonderful!  A touchingly beautiful tale.  The musical score and the photography was lovely!  A hidden gem! Absolutely brilliant. Engaging from start to finish with a proper sting in the tail. I love a movie like this that just draws you in and you are wondering each moment where it's leading. Beautifully filmed and acted. Captivating story with a few twists. If watching at home turn on the subtitles for several of the characters with heavy accents. Well worth watching in a theatre though given the incredible scenery. I thought the movie was really good and I loved watching it a cinephile's delight, intense story, sublime landscapes, a tour de force of reconstruction of the life of the perfect era, actors at the top
will certainly remain one of my pleasure cine films 2023 Very moving story. Makes excellent use of the local and coastal seascapes.
Watch for the human interaction. This isn't a historical-accurate film, but a human-story film.

Utterly outstanding performance by the lead actress. Amazing cinematography, setting and costumes let down by a loosely constructed storyline and ill-fitting script. This movie could have been so much better. Loved it. Very emotional. Great photography in a most interesting setting This was such a surprise - I watched it on a flight and I'm so glad I did! Not very uplifting. The characters didn't relate that well to each other. Gaps in the storyline and a glossy ending. I had wanted to like it, but it's not how it turned out.

Drama,the_three_musketeers_part_i_dartagnan,98,81,"Though one can question some of the filmmakers’ decisions, generally they pull off the attempt to revivify Dumas’ flavorful swashbuckler for modern audiences.  It is romantic in the classic sense of the word. These characters have values, and although the film is frequently funny, it never sneers at honor or chivalry. When Athos announces he would rather die than betray his King, we believe him.  D’Artagnan proves itself a highly worthy contestant amongst its predecessors, shining with exemplary visual craft, writing and acting. What this installment energetically proves is that you can ruffle the feathers of a totemic tale and still capture what’s good, galloping fun in Dumas’ storytelling. THE THREE MUSKETEERS: D’ARTAGNAN tells the first half of the story, and is the first from France in decades, filled with sword fights and palace intrigue, but never losing sight of the characters amidst all of the swashbuckling. Dumas was a master of the serial form, and this version of “The Three Musketeers” manages to preserve that thrill-to-thrill sensation. Slick and stylish, this latest cinematic adaptation of the venerable adventure saga hardly breaks any new ground, but it showcases a strong cast and some exciting action sequences. It helps that the cast is excellent, the production design exquisite, and the camera appropriately frenetic. These musketeers have panache, and I am all here for it. ...a real old-fashioned swashbuckler, full of sword fights, handsome men and pretty ladies, improbably accurate gunplay (with smoothbore weapons!), stunning locations, candlelit interiors, wild stunts... The machinations of the French court, its enemies and protectors, wide network of spies and the Three Musketeers’ derring-do bring Dumas’ novel to vivid life.
 The Three Musketeers: Part I – D'Artagnan recalls a different, older type of filmmaking, and it's fun and exciting, too. The production values are exquisite, the cinematography gorgeous and the fighting sequences exciting. It’s on a par with Richard Lester’s 1972 version, and that is saying something. There’s no place for camp in this film. Maybe it’s that it’s presented in French, the original novel’s mother tongue, but this is an honouring tale that gives new life to the classic story, and a more elevated version of D'Artagnan.  Well-produced, mildly engaging and occasionally thrilling, but undercooked and overstuffed. It's lucky to have a fine ensemble cast. Wielding the perfect balance between classic storytell","What makes this adaptation of the work of Alexandre Dumas different is that it is more faithful to the original idea, due to its solemn style, without the classic formula of swordsman cinema. That makes it an object of curiosity, especially because of the imminent chapters. D'Artagnan é um jovem gascão que quer se tornar um mosqueteiro real. Porém, logo que chega a Paris, ele interfere em um ataque é quase morto e enterrado. De volta a Paris, ele inicia uma amizade com os famosos Três Mosqueteiros (Aramis, Athos e Porthos), ao mesmo tempo, que se vê envolvido em uma série de traições e golpes contra o Rei da França, Luis XIII. O filme é a primeira parte de uma aventura que adapta o clássico de Alexandre Dumas, inúmeras vezes já feito para o cinema. O filme tem uma boa direção de arte e figurino. O roteiro é bem fiel ao livro, tomando algum liberdades, como tornar Porthos bissexual. O elenco é muito bom, com destaque para Eva Green como a ardilosa Milady, nome pela qual não é denominada em nenhum momento do filme. Não há grandes novidades, mas apenas um bom filme de aventuras, de capa e espada para nos divertir. A well-made classic story, good camera and set design. If you've read the book and still like this movie you must have superbly low expectations. What is the point of adapting a novel if you're gonna make up 70% of the plot? Are the writers smarter than Dumas? They apparently think they can write something better than a classic beloved by many generations.

The characters are too old - yes I'm agist, sue me. Athos, a character only slightly older than the rest of the musketeers, but still a man in his prime, is here a grandpa. Eva Green looks like she could be his daughter, not ex-wife. Speaking of which, although she is an amazing actress - also too old for Mylady, which according to the books is only around 27. Also she is just this menacing unknown entity doing the dirty work for the cardinal and lacking the sophistication and aristocratic standing from the books - we don't even get to know her as Mylady Winter. There is huge plotline in the book which centers around her being a ""Winter"" and her brother-in-law. She is also capable of being extremely charming, yet devious - something we can see only in one short scene with D'Artagnan (im which she has the blonde wig on). 

Aramis was torturing someone with a cross - what the hell is that?? He is a man of God, yes not a perfect one, but Aramis from the book would NEVER behave in such a way.

Drama,the_end_we_start_from,81,86," Comer has pretty much proven that she can play any kind of role and do it masterfully, carrying this film almost entirely on her sturdy shoulders. Yet in among this unforgiving environment is a story of hope, perseverance, and courage embodied by the incredible Comer, who was so brilliant in TV's Killing Eve. The End We Start From leaves most of its spectacle to the imagination, freeing Belo to train her camera on the whirlwind of emotions that storm across Comer’s face. “The End We Start From” is an anxiety-inducing experience, not due to loud explosions or effects-driven set pieces, but due to things that feel real and grounded in truthful observations. It's a solid story that looks and sounds great, but I wouldn't be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion that's ravaging Mom's heart. [T]he third act of The End We Start From is underwhelming, compared to the rising human and survivalist drama that makes the first two acts compelling... The End We Start From isn’t a big, blockbuster disaster movie. It’s quiet and sometimes still and it asks you to think about our existence. But it’s also meaningful, finding unlikely splendor in the midst of destruction. THE END WE START FROM is a dramatic thriller driven by the outstanding performance from Comer.  THE END WE START FROM is an impressive beginning for Belo as a new filmmaker. And it does add to the already extraordinary resume that is Comer’s.  An engrossing, tender and refreshingly nuanced emotional journey. Jodi Comer gives a radiant and raw performance.  In more ways than one, the film comes off like “A Quiet Place Part II” without the scary creatures. If you liked Children of Men, chances are you will enjoy this film. It has the same blend of despondency and lyricism, hope and despair, beauty and violence. While Jodie Comer leads the movie with a committed, subdued and surprising performance, it’s not enough to keep this sparse movie afloat. Bolstered by Jodie Comer’s fantastic leading performance, Mahalia Belo’s The End We Start From is a powerful debut that delivers a thoughtful approach to the end of the world. The End We Start From falls short of being a meaningful observation on the perils of climate injustice, but the film succeeds as an embodiment of maternal commitment, largely due to Comer’s wonderfully present performance. Mahalia Belo’s The End We Start From sees Emmy-winning Jodie Comer navigate a story as muddy as the f",A poignant and riveting post apocalyptic thriller. Jodie comers performance alone is worth the watch. Profoundly English & an extremely meditative study of the primal essence of protecting one’s child.,"{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.88569575548172, 'Negative': 0.005365042481571436, 'Neutral': 0.020920976996421814, 'Mixed': 0.0880182757973671}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '385452b0-4c59-4854-adfe-dd57da7d9c73', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '385452b0-4c59-4854-adfe-dd57da7d9c73', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '161', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:24 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9992678761482239, 'Negative': 3.61400016117841e-05, 'Neutral': 0.0006377683603204787, 'Mixed': 5.830528607475571e-05}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '33bb5668-c578-4d26-b88a-2d69cd610978', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '33bb5668-c578-4d26-b88a-2d69cd610978', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '164', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:28 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.88569575548172,0.005365042481571436,0.020920976996421814,0.0880182757973671,POSITIVE,0.9992678761482239,3.61400016117841e-05,0.0006377683603204787,5.830528607475571e-05,POSITIVE
Drama,the_persian_version,82,92,"Girls succeed, and fun remains the operating mood for The Persian Version movie. A vibrant comedy that perfectly balances the film’s dramatic overtone with continuous pockets of levity. It’s a story of determination and independence, filled with headstrong female characters overcoming misogynistic prejudice.

I just finished it and honesty I'm so impressed by the original story of it. My Iranian heart can't be more emotional tonight. Shout out to all the casts amd whoever was involved in making this lovely piece of art. Absolutely hilarious. Loved it. At the beginning it seems a classical politically correct movie, but soon we discover a real life story who makes us laugh and cry in the same time. To movie is very good and the story too. Even the soundtrack makes a great job on it. I really enjoyed and all the characters (there are alot) are remarkable. Molto bello! Great directing, excellent acting and overall a perfect comedy yet a tear jerker. I am Persian and have lived most of my life in Iran. This movie doesn't come close to capturing the essence of Persian culture. The portrayal of life in Iran, both now and in the past, doesn't align with reality. The actors, their attire, the movie's settings, and the cultural references are far from accurate representations of Iran and Iranians. In terms of the film itself, there are numerous issues. For instance, Sheerin (the mom) undergoes drastic changes in skin color and eye color when depicted at a younger age, lacking any resemblance to her older self. Overall, this movie falls significantly below average. How refreshing to see a film by  Iranian-American Artists!!! I loved how the film spanned over three generations: from the small country village of the grandmother, to the American city of the newly arrived immigrant mother, and finally, the modern day American culture of the granddaughter.  The film hits hard at first with a look at the youngest of the three females, whose lifestyle is difficult for her mother to swallow.  Interestingly the grandmother, perhaps having grown more accepting and wiser over the years, has a closer connection to her granddaughter. As the story progresses, the youngest learns the background story of her mother, who it turns out,  is probably the biggest heroine of the three, despite her stoic demeanor.  The end of this movie had me in tears.  It was a wonderful, moving narrative about culture, realized and unrealized dreams, fortitude, family, judgement, and most importantly, LOVE. Very well put together lively entertaining and culturally informative. Would like to see more Iranian American films.

Comedy,wonka,83,89,"This film is supposed to be a fun diversion with simple emotional appeal, catchy songs, and some dark undertones, and that’s precisely what it is. You can hear Roald Dahl rolling in his grave, but gently, gently. Wonka is pure imagination, full of joy and whimsy. Timothée Chalamet floats on air in his most charismatic performance yet in this rousing musical stacked with captivating songs and a cast who came to play. There are issues with Wonka, make no mistake, but in King’s hands, it’s not the empty corporate endeavor it could have been. The movie aims to please and mostly succeeds, even if it’s so goofily earnest you occasionally want to punch it in the face. With its delightful combination of magic, humor, and heart, Wonka is a cinematic confection that will leave audiences with a sweet taste and a renewed belief in the magic of dreams. Well this was a pleasant surprise! A family flick with a wonderful performance by Timothée Chalamet, who has enough charm to sustain the 2-hour runtime.  This enchanting, magical, family-friendly adventure may be the most pleasant surprise of 2023.  In a world that at times seems to have turned sour and colorless, Wonka brings much needed sweetness and beauty, making it a perfect diversion for the holiday season. It doesn’t always work, but Chalamet is more than good enough to carry it through its wobblier patches. A lavish, cheery and benign family entertainment. I thought [Timothée Chalamet] was great; he has the charismatic likeability you want from a  protagonist in this kind of a story. A technicolor tonic for these trying times, and Timmy's a hoot The candy-colored visuals go a long way to compensate for a script that can be a muddle, stretched taffy-thin by too many villains, subplots and characters who are not given much to do.  King is above all a pleasure-giver. He wants to heighten the knockabout joys of unfettered high spirits. It’s a clunky, crowded story, and one that could’ve done with considerable trimming. The snoozy prequel to 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' drags viewers on a factory tour devoid of vocal talent, interesting characters and pure imagination. At this point in late stage capitalism, we are used to reboots, remakes, and sequels. Wonka is the latest victim ... It ignores the tone of its predecessors, trying for whimsy over delusion, the result a boring hour and fifty-two minutes. With a whimsical recipe that includes a heavy helping of sentimentality, it functions as a lesser compani","enjoyed it completely. Great story, colors, music, and acting. Go see this movie. It just wonderful Low expectations going in but quickly found myself watching a wonderful cinematic creation. Bravo Loved the end and the song! Brought tears to my eyes remembering my favorite childhood movies A generic christmas children's movie wearing the skin of a character it has no real relation to. Sad to see an interesting character reduced to a grating lol random cartoon character Great Movie but the Studio giving away Wonka Bars only on friday is a bad decision for the die hard fans that caught the show early. We get nothing !! We came into this movie expecting to be disappointed. The marketing did nothing to get me excited for this film. In fact the only reason I went to see it was Regal gave me a free IMAX ticket. I'm so glad I went, we had a blast with this movie. The new songs were so catchy and Timothy's version of Pure Imagination was so heart felt. Can't wait to see this movie for a second time! Great Movie, Gene Wilder was The Best Wonka, but Timothe Chalamae did Wonka justice. Terrible and boring, but very nive esthetic. Chalamer is a good actor as well and singer Funny. Great singing. Fantastic cast. The film delivers very well on its promises, very lively music and well-defined characters. great movie, they left out some of wonkas character but thats my only complaints Loved the story. I also liked that it was a musical movie. Storyline is unlike other Wonka movies.  Music was excellent. Wonka was a fun look at how Willy Wonka came to be who he was in the early films. I feel like a lot of the creepy nature of the original Wonka was missing from the film, which was what I was looking forward to seeing again. Everything looked amazing and the story was mildly mediocre. Definity a fun watch with the family, but not so much on your own. A must-see musical. It's one of my favorite movies of the year. Aburrida y predecible, el actor principal no destaca en nada y su actuación resulta muy sosa. Great story and very well acted by all. Very true to the characters in Wilders Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The story was well written and refreshing to see something not overly focused on dumb one liners or stunts. Take this for what it is a GREAT movie, well-acted by all, good effects, and music. Worth seeing in a theater which cannot be said about a lot of movies these days.

Comedy,trolls_band_together,60,92,"Fans will love the music, but the story falls short, and the character-growth is lackluster. …unlike Barbie, there’s no take on the material at all here, it’s just an advert for a brand of dolls, a ‘joy bomb’ that resolutely fails to explode… A passable, middling candy-coloured time killer, though it moves so fast it doesn’t allow much time to get involved with the characters or engage with the story. It’s like an iridescent blur set to pop songs. This is the third installment of the Trolls franchise, so it's not surprising that it has all the individuality and inspiration of a Big Mac.  Trolls Band Together has enough of the right stuff to keep the target audience and their kids entertained. It’s a veritable feast of boy band-related gags, many of which are hilarious. This movie is a disjointed piece of non-stop stimuli. It’s an attack on the senses where the set pieces blend into each other. It genuinely feels like an acid trip at times. DreamWorks Animation will keep churning them out, but Trolls Band Together would be a perfect place to end this mildly successful fun run of splashy color, slick music, and wacky energy. I will give Trolls Band Together this much: it is the first film in the series that did not give me a headache. At a mile-a-minute, Trolls Band Together rarely allows a moment to catch your breath, but when it’s having so much fun, I don’t really think anyone will complain. The whole movie feels a bit like a laboratory for playing with new examples of the series' defined aesthetic. it’s all fun, with enjoyable tunes new and old, and some very impressive animation as well.  The sibling focus means that younger viewers will get to see Branch humorously (and movingly) interact with his big brothers (who still see him as a baby), which adds depth to his behavior in the first movie.  With even more glitter, this high-energy sequel is an almost mind-boggling flurry of colour, music, comedy and action mayhem. Apart from the intricacy of some of the animation, there’s nothing exceptional about Trolls Band Together. But it is exactly what it is designed to be – amiable, tuneful, brisk and upbeat. Its ambitions are modest, but it fulfills them entirely.

There are some funny moments but the story doesn't really know where it wants to go. The main characters are more background characters, and the strangest is when the style of the film changes and the trolls and the surrounding feel like being made by a different studio. Predictable plot. First movie was great, this movie is just building on its success. Kids are obsessed and watched it multiple times. The Greatest Movie of All Time! This movie was so fun and cute! The songs were great and all the jokes hit, the plot was really engaging and had a nice message. I really hope they make another one. the movie was great, it was clean and the staff was friendly!!! This film was extremely fantastic and awesome. The songs were so perfect and catchy, the voice acting from the cast for each character was excellent and the character development in the film was interesting and very great. The writing and screenplay were good and weren't as bad as I thought it would be. There were some heartfelt messages and emotional scenes that made me cry from the inside, and the movie was somehow hilarious and heartwarming.

Reuniting with your long-lost family members, making up for the bad and tough times you've had in past and the love that you felt for them are the reasons that make you strong and realise being who you are now together with them is how you live in harmony. Letting go of the past, healing yourself in the present and being the person that you are is what it means to achieve harmony.

Comedy,wish_2023,49,81,"It’s difficult to get excited about a movie that feels as empty as Wish does. Disney must step back and not rely on our love of existing stories.  It's a solid, solid way to celebrate its anniversary.  Wish’s release coincides with the 100th anniversary of Walt Disney Studios. Unfortunately, this only highlights what is missing from this by-the-numbers fairytale that never comes close to emulating the magic of the past.  Wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams. It's another charming chapter in Disney's vast library, offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages. The real draw is the animation. It's like WISH took 2D cell paintings and modeled them in 3D. The duality can be jarring at first, but quite beautiful the more you sit with it. While not an instant classic, the music-filled adventure is a wholly enjoyable, perfectly pleasant cinematic experience — one with a message about holding on to and working toward one’s dreams. I enjoyed this movie, even though I felt a bit left out by it. I recommend watching this film with subtitles which include song lyrics (some subtitles include song lyrics, some don't). [The] opening sequence highlights Wish‘s biggest problem: the writing and directing just don’t match up. The unfortunate result is a movie that never lives up to its potential. On the basis of its half-thought-out script, Hollywood writers’ fears of being supplanted by artificial intelligence appear well-founded. This movie seems proud, even smug, about recycling scraps from other fairy tales. Wish features plenty of classic Disney nods, a great performance from DeBose, and two solid musical numbers. Unfortunately, this story feels rushed, scattered, and extremely familiar. The villainous arc goes nowhere, and the spark is somewhat missing. … a centennial production that manages to do what Disney have repeatedly struggled with and properly tap back into that sense of wonder and childlike joy that audiences to this day associate with the studio. Disney once upon a time provided outstanding movie magic for the entire family. Sadly that time has passed. Ironically, in its desire to celebrate Disney magic, Wish fails to generate any magic of its own. For anyone looking to feel the magic of Disney, there are at least 50 better options available on Disney+.  At a breezy 95 minutes, Wish doesn’t overstay its welcome and kids are sure to enjoy the cute critters and slapstick set piec","I think I've legitimately seen better AI shorts on YouTube. This hot corporate-written garbage could be weaponized and violate the Geneva Convention. If this is Disney's celebration of 100 years it's time we cremate the corpse of the company, and maybe Bob Iger for good measure Story felt pretty lazy. Super cute  movie a bit different and story line is absolutely terrific. Keep your wishes!!!! This movie is for the true Disney fans. Whilst I can understand how it might not be a big hit with everyone, I think this movie has a fantastic sense of magic, purpose and finding your destiny , which we all love in a Disney movie. The songs and story line was fantastic, and the many, many hidden Disney nods and Easter eggs were a Disney fans dream to celebrate the 100th. I will be seeing it again just to try and find more hidden gems and to warm my soul. Will this become a Disney Classic? No. Does it represent Disney in a Classical Way? Yes. Simply put it is a Cookie Cutter film. The plot lines and song cues are neon sign-posted to the point of one's internal monologue counting off, ""and a-one and a-two"". This in no way however detracts from a fun set of characters with a truly stunning display of animation. I have never before seen texture like they have in this animated film. It isn't just rich, it is luscious! Oh, and the star is the best character since Aladdin's Magic Carpet… period. Did....I just watch a plotline written by artificial intelligence? If so Disney proved there is more than one way to create the uncanny valley effect.

I felt distinctly ill at ease as , I caught the whiff of Disney's classic's,  churned out so clumsily it seems almost impossible to think a human was responsible.

It took me a while realise why I felt so at odds with the characters. The characters in this movie mere shadows of Gaston, Zazu and Moana. The songs dragged from the trenches of recent Disney remakes didn't help with the over all feel that nobody cared too much about this film when making it.

I have never walked out of a movie before.

Today, thanks to wish, I actually did.

I actually did. Best Disney movie ever.  They incorporated multiple Disney characters into it. Loved it so much. I was impressed on how rebellious Disney acted through this movie. Alone the idea of letting it play out on Rosas - an island that people really constructed to be free from governments, which then got destroyed by the italian force.

Comedy,love_actually,64,72,"... Curtis and company remind us that love, actually, is everywhere no matter the time of year, period, or place. That’s what helps make it a staple watch this and any other time of year. A cringe 10 for the price of one bulk holiday sale of the most well-worn rom-com tropes. The film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested.  Richard Curtis’ Love Actually claims the prize of being the “ultimate romantic comedy” not through daring or originality, but by covering every cliché imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style. ...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics... The work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life. A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish. It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations. A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand. It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies. Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them. There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy. The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking. Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two. This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments. Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire. Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers. If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock. Out of the cacophony of other, newly minted love affairs that promise eternal love fo","Read how much everyone loved this movie, especially at Christmas, so my wife & I watched.  It's a total cheeseball that may have been OK when released but doesn't hold up today at all.  I want my two hours back. An enduring holiday classic worth watching every year. “The Brits are coming; the Brit’s are coming!” Extremely cheesy, hasn't held up well, bad plot lines. In fact really isn't a plot. Couldn't wait for it to end. Got to see it as a 20th anniversary showing on the big screen and so glad I did!  What a fun romp that was!  Here I am seeing it 20 years after the fact and find it was one of the freshest Rom Com's I've ever seen!  I mean, who'd have thought the likes of Alan Rickman & Liam Neeson would be in a movie playing such sympathetic characters!  And Rowan Atkinson's cameo was a hoot as was Bill Nighy's portrayal of an aging bad boy rock star!  And no, we're not forgetting the ""birds"" (in keeping with the British vernacular) as led by Emma Thompson and Laura Linney.  But the actress who stole my heart and was the object of desire for both Prime Ministers and Presidents, was Martine McCutcheon as a working class cutie, Natalie.  Although you can certainly see why someone would fall for their best friend's gal when they are played by the beautiful Keira Knightley.  This is the perfect film to take your honey to, and let the magic of this Christmas Rom Com do the rest! Love Actually gives too much time to certain plot lines, while not giving enough attention to others. The thread that ties all of the stories together is not tight enough. My favorite Christmas movie! Like how the stories intermingle and catch something new every time I watch.  You really need to rent and watch on a streaming service to get the real dialogue or too much will be cut.  This movie will make you laugh and cry several times.  A great mingling of rom-coms! ""Love Actually"" the ultimate romantic comedy? Sure it plays out like a comedy but it also has some bits of drama including an Academy Award® nominee performance by Emma Thompson. The story is about how love effects everyone around not just a single person. Even if the plot of the movie drags on for quite a bit the star studded cast is the redeeming part of this holiday comedy. Can't decide if I want to give this 4 or 4.5 stars. The highs are high, but the lows are dull. The movie could do with like 3 less stories, and it would be a lot shorter and cleaner. Regardless, here's my rankings:

Comedy,next_goal_wins_2023,43,85,"Although some of the jokes may be somewhat funny, the truth is that this has more to do with the performer's charisma than with the lazy script. [Full review in Spanish] Amidst full euphoria for the anniversary of the consecration of La Scaloneta, Next Goal Wins is the right film. [Full review in Spanish] It's not a holiday film at all, but it has that spirit.  While there isn't anything too revolutionary or revealing in this comedy, Next Goal Wins plays out pleasantly and with a playful spirit that's most appreciated. [Full review in Spanish] The team, the league and the coach behind it all seems like a genuinely inspirational backbone to this film but Taika's over-the-top, although funny when it strikes properly, humor belittles an otherwise motivational tale. We know what to expect going into Next Goal Wins, and, yes, Waititi’s take on a sports movie is both chock full of chuckles and intermittently frustrating. Two yellow cards for the hackneyed feel-good farce. Next Goal Wins is rushed in almost every way ... While sweet at times, it doesn't have that laugh-out-loud moment that Taika often brings to the table. Based on the American Samoa soccer team’s comeback from a devastating loss (31-0) to Australia, it shows what a new coach did to rally the dejected. In other words, it’s a southern hemisphere “Ted Lasso.” While Next Goal Wins follows the traditional structure of the sports movie (it all leads to the Big Game), it undermines the genre from within. It’s even narratively adventurous: fourth walls get broken and critical junctures are dealt with offhandedly. This is the straightest, almost least Taikery of the Taika films, but it still marches to the beat of his drum. For the most part it's a very jovial and upbeat film.  There are many charming moments in this movie, and a lot of funny stuff.  Does provide some cheery, if predictable, family viewing, but it lacks originality and that certain special spark that made the director’s earlier films, such as Boy, so delightfully, laugh-out-loud funny. The fact is, the movie has nothing new to offer other than the typical cliche-filled sports picture. Next Goal Wins certainly isn’t a terrible outing, nor is it unwatchable; it just doesn’t seem nearly as challenging or risky as most of what Waititi has given us before, and from someone like him, that’s a shame. Next Goal Wins is generic and impersonal compared to the likes of Waititi’s Boy (2010) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016). Blending dry humor, br","Completely enjoyed this film. I took a group of 7 cousins, ranging from 10years old - mid to late teens including us in our 30s and every single person loved it! We all walked out of the theatre with big smiles on our faces and non stop chatter about it in the car ride home. I think, if you liked the 90s Movie Cool Runnings, then you'll love this movie. It's funny yes, somewhat satirical but I think that's a cultural thing... I know somewhat of a sensitive topic, but we went into the movie with no expectations and walked out thoroughly entertained! A rare misfire from writer-director Taika Waititi whose films I had generally liked, this based-on-a-true-story sports underdog movie is mostly a Ted Lasso-like retread of Cool Runnings with minor topical updates. After a humiliating defeat, the terrible American Samoa national football team, who has yet to score one international goal, gets Michael Fassbender's Dutch-American Thomas Rongen, who has personal baggage of his own, as their coach and 4 weeks to shape themselves up before an imminent World Cup qualifier match. Beginning less than promisingly with an unnecessary and unfunny introduction by Waititi in full Samoan priest garb, which strikes a wrong note with me from the start, there's nothing here that surprises as its main narrative unfolds. Except for a well-handled and almost touching subplot with Kaimana's transsexual player Jaiyah, which is the one ingredient here that makes this feels 2023, even if these events took place more than a decade ago. A conventional IKEA assembly of a movie, occasionally interrupted by Waitiki's irreverent sense of humour, the player's eccentricities, and their distinctive Samoan-ism are heightened for comedic effect, but at times it can come dangerously close to the film laughing at, rather than with, them. Nevertheless, those parts are the main reasons why anyone will warm to the story, while a somewhat lost Fassbender do his best to keep out of the way of the film. Ultimately, it just doesn't quite gel together despite the almighty efforts of a frothy script and Waititi's sparkling direction to make this as spiritually uplifting as possible and that inevitably feelgood ending feels more like a fluke-ish one-off accident rather than genuine character development or growth. Just about watchable as a piece of crowd-pleasing escapism for an undemanding audience looking for a bit of laid back Samoan sunshine and positivity in their lives. Definitely feel good movie of 202","{'Sentiment': 'MIXED', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.15789693593978882, 'Negative': 0.0009405771852470934, 'Neutral': 0.010907593183219433, 'Mixed': 0.830254852771759}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '0982b2ff-0a9b-482c-84e5-3778e48eafb5', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '0982b2ff-0a9b-482c-84e5-3778e48eafb5', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '160', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:24 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9997052550315857, 'Negative': 5.898041126783937e-05, 'Neutral': 0.00012682745000347495, 'Mixed': 0.00010887469397857785}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '4710c792-d518-45b7-97be-5d61a6f836e2', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '4710c792-d518-45b7-97be-5d61a6f836e2', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '167', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:29 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.15789693593978882,0.0009405771852470934,0.010907593183219433,0.830254852771759,MIXED,0.9997052550315857,5.898041126783937e-05,0.00012682745000347495,0.00010887469397857785,POSITIVE
Comedy,barbie,88,83,"For all the great things Robbie and Gosling are doing on a comedic level, their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature accepting another's lived experience and desires.

 A sassy comedy that raises questions for people of all ages about what it means to frame your life as a quest.
 Barbie is feminism 101, but for the global mainstream audience who have been served nothing but depoliticised superheroes for decades, the directness of Barbie's feminism is an essential step for reclaiming the soul of the Hollywood blockbuster.

 [Barbie] takes our complicated real-world relationship to Barbie and uses it as a metaphor to interrogate the impossibly high, often contradictory standards women are held to in our male-dominated culture. To watch Barbie is to feel totally and completely seen. And that's what makes Barbie worthy of the wait.  The laughs are plentiful and the set design is eye-popping, but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of numerous themes. Barbie boasts impressive production design, costumes, and a pair of leads up to the task of bringing their respective dolls to life, but sadly comes up a little short when it comes to its screenplay. The film’s boldness and, frankly, weirdness, allows Barbie to become a successful sum of its parts. It’s a film that clearly has something to say and doesn’t want audiences to get caught up in the fact that it’s a doll at the center of it. One of the best films of the year in cinematographic terms, probably the best comedy that we have seen in a long time, and an extraordinarily entertaining product that promotes the value of searching for a more cohesive society.

Though presented as a funny c","This movie is way overrated and everyone that says they like it is straight up lyingggg. This movie was so boring. I don’t know why people liked it so much, why this movie made so much money. Ambitious, charming and funny. While this movie had a subtle message, overall I thought it was without substance. Afterwards (for the first time in my life) I thought to myself, ""That was 2 hours of my life I will never get back!"".  I guess I just do NOT understand what all the hype is about. My adult daughter was with me and her review matched mine. It was 2 hours of cotton candy - all fluff and air. I was so excited to go see Oppenheimer... and really only bought tickets for Barbie as well because you know... the whole OppenBarbie thing.... OMG... so glad I did. Opp was a snooze fest... that's right, nudity, sex, the biggest bombs in history and so much TALKING.... drag tail out of there and into BARBIE... soothing, hilarious, joyful, multi-layered, heart touching, and kind of a musical... wait I was exhilarated by kind of a musical? YES. Oh youdangbetcha yes. So if you haven't seen it yet... you are so lucky! It's still in your future! Please, see Opp first... like a gin and tonic.... and then see Barbie... a delicious shroomy cherry fizz. 🙂 The storyline was very generic, and the movie wasn't funny to me, and I should at least laugh once in a comedy. The acting was really good though and I think the two leads did really well. But unfortunately the message of the movie was confusing and inconsistent. So I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Movie that made me thought about it for a long time. One of the worst movies I have seem. Seem like the creators of Barbie never filmed movie before and their first attempt is you would expect. I was surprised by the real life social lessons that the movie provides, and it is honestly a fun way to bring Barbie to the big screen without resulting in a tasteless comedy. The scenery and characterization were really on point, too. Just not what you would expect to see on a Barbie movie: it's better! Fun to watch but totally a mistake to cast Ryan Gosling as Ken.

Comedy,waitress_the_musical,100,98,"Watch the film version of the musical, and you’ll find out what baking can do. Baking up a storm of humor and heart, the pro-shot Broadway production with Bareilles leading the charge is the perfect treat this holiday season. While Waitress is still probably a dish best served live, like Hamilton and Come From Away, seeing this event presentation feels like a good idea. The show is smoothly staged before an appreciative audience, with well-chosen theatrical touches.  This is Bareilles’s show in every way. While she doesn’t quite match the emotional subtlety of Jessie Mueller, who originated Jenna, she has grown in leaps and bounds as an actress and provides a warm anchor for the movie. ...combines the feeling of being in a Broadway audience with the advantages of a filmed performance that is preserved for posterity and can be viewed without buying a plane ticket to New York. This sweet story lends itself nicely to a musical... A lovely tribute to Adrienne Shelly. Most of the songs Bareillis wrote are upbeat, which matches the tone of the original Adrienne Shelly movie starring Keri Russell. When the music slows down for ballads, they are emotional and powerful. The film accomplishes its principal goal of capturing Sara Bareilles’s spectacular take on Jenna Hunterson, especially in its close-ups of the singer-songwriter. Bareilles...is splendid here, especially when delivering her Act 2 tour de force, ""She Used to Be Mine."" Sure, the show can be super-sugary and sentimental, but I was sold. And now I am hungry for pie. But even if the musical’s attempt to give back to the medium that birthed the source material is uneven, it accomplishes its main important goal: It will help more people see this wonderful piece of musical theater.","Sara Bareilles is so talented. I would have loved if Jason Mraz played Dr. Jim Pomatter for the movie (He played him on Broadway for a limited time.) I saw this when it was on Broadway and this is actually better, you get every nuance and emotion from the actors. Sara Barielles not only wrote all the music, she can ACT and has such great comedic and dramatic abilities. Please go see it if it's playing in your city this week! One of the best filmed musicals I've ever seen.  The cinematography captures the feel of the stage, while still making the audience feel like they are present in the diner and also capturing effective closeups of solos during emotional scenes.  The on stage transitions between scenes is so well done with the fact that both the stage hands and even the orchestra/band are regular members that go to the Diner were a majority of the story takes place.  The musical performances and acting is phenomenal as well. Loved it on the big screen.  Loved the music and the acting was incredible. Loved this movie.   Very entertaining musically and with the story line.  Not for younger kids under 13. The cast was exceptional
Sara Bareillis was amazing - as a writer, singer, and actress
The staging and choreographer was so creative and entertaining
The direction of the filming was simply glorious
Am going again this week Very authentic and raw.  This was something special.  The raw emotion from Sara as Jenna was incredible. To die for movie of one of my favorite Broadway shows ever!!! The cast is magnificent, story line emotional with hysterically funny script and gorgeous music!!! 
Will purchase this when it becomes available - and super happy to see it repeatedly in theatre when it plays for more than it's five consecutive days.
MUST SEE!!! Fun, but not as impressive as Hamilton (for example). Super fun with great music! Great real life themes that remind you what being human is about. Choreography was a little cheesy, but the music is fantastic! LOVED!!! So funny, witty and heartwarming. Love this movie capture of an amazing Broadway show! Every time I watch a movie in theatres I spend way too much money and have the feeling of maybe I shouldve just watched it on streaming. But this time nothing can come close to seeing Sara Bareilles on the big screen with such a beautifully crafted story. Im thankful to had catch the movie on its last day of screening. What a joy! Check out this movie when it hits Apple TV! This film is breathtaking, and a must see","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9332528710365295, 'Negative': 0.0011405725963413715, 'Neutral': 0.05803685635328293, 'Mixed': 0.007569656707346439}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'acf87e88-0262-4330-a7b5-2e8beb986037', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'acf87e88-0262-4330-a7b5-2e8beb986037', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '165', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:25 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9990618824958801, 'Negative': 0.00022310999338515103, 'Neutral': 0.0006761295953765512, 'Mixed': 3.889740037266165e-05}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'e0c55979-4969-4a14-aee3-c7c78e33100d', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'e0c55979-4969-4a14-aee3-c7c78e33100d', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '166', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:29 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.9332528710365295,0.0011405725963413715,0.05803685635328293,0.007569656707346439,POSITIVE,0.9990618824958801,0.00022310999338515103,0.0006761295953765512,3.889740037266165e-05,POSITIVE
Comedy,chicken_run_dawn_of_the_nugget,78,90,"Such is the standard of Aardman that even though Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget might be considered heads and tail feathers above some other animated films, it doesn’t compare favorably to the studio’s best work. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget isn’t as delightful as it should be. But it’s still fun, and absolutely fun enough for family movie night. If only the movie lived up to its witty title, in a Netflix film that’s mildly and sporadically amusing but mostly just an unnecessary, warmed-over rehash. The spirit and talent of Aardman Animation is all still present in this high energy romp ... it's kinda a nod at Die Hard while spinning the unique stop action animation in many hilarious ways. Can we remember the chickens and the egss of 23 years ago?  This new Chicken Run effort is another delightful stop-motion delight from the legendary Aardman studio. [The film] may not reach the heights of its predecessor, but it does contain enough good stuff to fill up a few hours. Despite twenty-three years between the first film and this sequel, the story feels as fresh and connected as it did back then. I hope we see more of these characters in years to come. The film makes so many callbacks and hat tips to “Chicken Run” that it feels less like a sequel and more like an inferior remake. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is fantastic in every way. It’s fun, it’s hilarious, and it’s filled with so much heart. Nostalgiac but never old, new but never detached from its roots, the film is one of the best animated features of the year.

 A sweet storyline about parenthood, a spunky new heroine, and the return of a terrifying villain help make Dawn of the Nugget a clucking good time. Fans of the first Chicken Run film will delight in the nostalgia with a new installment that features the same beloved characters, a fearsome foe and another mission worth crowing over. It was a hardly a necessary sequel to what was a pretty terrific original, but it does no harm to the initial premise and has enough clever new ideas to hold our interest. Consistently entertaining in its comic mayhem.  It’s all very silly and lacks the wit of some of Aardman’s other movies, but it’s adequate fast-food entertainment for the kids. While Aardman films have always looked and sounded like no other, this has a generic rather than a quirky, handmade feel. Chances are you’ve had bigger disappointments in life, but it is a disappointment all the same.  The second half is somewhat more conventional and ","Loved this!  I usually don't enjoy animated movies, but this one is a beautiful exception. The sequel brings back the grandeur of the first film, even better, the film is very visually beautiful, the voice acting is impeccable, the film's script was very well written, I wasn't bothered at any point by the film. It surpasses the first film in every aspect, especially in terms of ADVENTURE. I highly recommend watching this film, we don't wait 23 years for nothing. SPECTACULAR FILM. I Loves First Chicken Run & Chicken Run 2 is Amazing & Having Fun Watch Chicken Run 2 Great movie loved every second of it Fantastic sequel with an amazing storyline.

Debo decir que la película presenta una mejora en la técnica de la animación del clay motion  y la historia es divertida y agradable que gracias a los carismáticos personajes logra que está película este al nivel de la primera ya que mantiene el ritmo toda la película gracias a su  guión  e historia que tiene potencial para una serie o tal vez una tercera parte , aunque espero sea con un nuevo enemigo para que no sea el algo repetitivo aquel lo dudo porque está vez se presenta una especie de centro de reeducación o zombieficacion bastante oscuro que fue bastante interesante y se exploró la idea de una manera bastante correcta

Horror,thanksgiving_2023,84,79,"The real villain in this is American consumerism.  Nonetheless, in the times of horror films with elaborate twists, a return to a conventional narrative structure is gratifying. [Full review in Spanish] With stronger plotting and characters worth rooting for, this raucously amusing but forgettable genre carve-up might have stirred more gratitude. I appreciate good practical effects, and that's what we get in this movie. Gory and often unpleasant, Thanksgiving follows the rules of the slasher genre and not much else. [Full review in Spanish] Roth mustered all his energy into this effort. Armed with everything he learned over his career, Roth’s positioned to make the next great holiday horror classic. The structure and killer reveal are a little wonky, and at times it feels like Roth and Jeff Rendell are trying to shoe horn in elements from the faux trailer, but the kills are solid and the vibe is very fun A gory good time that doesn't aspire to be anything more than a fun slasher, a goal that it wholeheartedly achieves. This is an insane experience but in the best way. This over-the-top kill-fest sticks to its guns until the very end and provides some memorable thrills along the way. The protagonists blend together and feel unmemorable, but the tone is consistent. The film's well-executed (pun intended) thrills make it a feast.  ...a passable endeavor that generally does feel like it should be much, much better. This gory slasher movie is happily absent director Eli Roth's former cruel, misogynistic touches, taking instead a playful, self-aware approach that's both fun and darkly funny.  Yes, the premise is silly, but the movie knows it, winking at the audience with absurd scenarios and over-the-top gore. It is more attuned to contemporary trauma than any other movie. This horror flick about modern obscenity helps us see it for ourselves. It's a fun movie to see with a crowd. This does what it does really well, and I had a good time. This festive special is grisly laughs done just right. A new film to be thankful for. Thanksgiving not only pays homage to, and, at the same time, parodies the classic slasher, but brings it to the era of the iPhone and social networks. [Full review in Spanish] A fun slasher that plays on the tropes of the genre really well. It might not break new ground but it delivers on the classic elements that make the genre enjoyable for fans.","This was everything you want in a silly slasher film. I loved that it did not take itself too seriously and just when things got a bit ""scary"" something would happen that also made you laugh which is a delicate balance which this movie pulled off well. I do think it came with a little bit extra gore just for the sake of gore that did not really advance the story though. Overall solid campy movie that tied a bow on the Thanksgiving turkey in a way that does not seem like Thanksgiving 2 is imminent. Loved it, great story, great kills, a new horror icon is born. Thanksgiving was the most creative horror movies I've seen, while also keeping the 90s slasher feel. I also really liked the mystery aspect to it, and the way they tied Thanksgiving themes to the movie, was very clever. This movie was an instant thanksgiving classic. Why show horror when the world falls in love at this time of year. Poor choice perhaps 🤔 Amei cada segundo, qualidade demaisssssss starts out with a good premise but gets really bad after that and you're supposed to be able to figure out who the bad guy is there is almost no way that you would ever be able to figure out who it is The holiday is the hook, but this is just another movie about a psycho killing teenagers (and not very realistically).  There is no suspense or originality here. Honestly this movie wasn't great. Expected so much more from Eli Roth. Truly disappointed. It was like a C- scream film. Loved it; not at all what I was thinking it was going to be. Good story, though I did predict the ending half way through… very good. Decent holiday slasher. I like terror and even horror movies but this one crossed the line . This was a disgusting and bloody movie. Cannot qualify as entertainment at all. it was boring, nothing original nor new about this. I might as well call it a comedy. Good kills and very nice makeup.
The effects can be weird at times and the cuts to straight, but the creativity with the plot and gruesome deaths makes up for it! I loved the movie. It kept me interested from the beginning to the end. It is really a must see!!! I really hope it's a part 2!!! 😃😃😃 I loooooooved this movie!! It kept me from beginning to end. I hope there's a part 2!! kinda weird literally It's everything I want from a slasher movie. Very fun and funny! Also brutal as hell! Bem violento e sanguinario.

Horror,five_nights_at_freddys,31,87,"Tammi does a great job bringing the 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video game to the big screen. Five Nights At Freddy’s could have done more to capture the simple terror of its video game inspiration’s storytelling. However, director Emma Tammi has delivered a crowd-pleasing retro horror that has the potential to be just as much of a cult favourite. Fight Nights at Freddy’s is just not effective enough as horror and has a slowly plodding pace that can’t be saved by its talent. The ending sort of sets up a sequel but if we are to spend any more nights at Freddy’s lets hope the creative team bring more fear and dread to make these animatronic antagonists less cuddly. A tame yet enjoyable triumph for fans of the video game. Those unfamiliar with the series might walk away feeling more lost than a devoted fan. You’d be forgiven for expecting a zany, over-the-top romp in which heroes battle the increasingly creepy cartoon animal-like robots as they fight to stay alive, but it isn’t that. Well, OK, it’s … kinda that … eventually. All this movie needs is Nic Cage and it'd be fine.  A deeply unpleasant and quite ridiculous game of hopscotch among devastating kidnapping thriller, nasty family drama, and empty serial killer nonsense. The film mostly concentrates on Mike’s familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.  Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it’s not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it’s not funny. It’s barely anything at all. A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you’ve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson. An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it’s all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza. A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun. So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found. Convoluted subplots risk derailing the narrative on more than one occasion, but Freddy and his menacing cohorts, created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, do just about enough to deliver some fun and frights. Seriously, how do you mess up a setup ","O filme é sensacional para aqueles que são fãs da franquia de ""Five Nights At Freddy's"", cheio de easter eggs. Porém, para o público de fora, o filme pode ser bem estranho, e até mesmo ruim. E mesmo fãs da franquia, ainda comentam que se decepcionaram com algumas cenas do filme, e a falta de terror que ele trás e que prometeu. It passed the time, for the one time. As a fan I thought this movie was very well thought out it had so many references to multiple different games in the f.n.a.f universe. I felt like a kid again watching this and reliving my childhood. Me gustó pero no me encantó, tiene mucho fan service, lo cual es bueno, pero no asusta, sus efectos y el hecho de estar lejos de la historia que todos conocemos, hace que no sea la mejor. This movie is great, the bite of 87 was scary, 
I love this movie it great and good, I wish fnaf 2 had a R Rated. This movie was THE BEST MOVIE OF MY WHOLE LIFE, it was totally worth the 8 year wait and when the movie finally comes out people say it's boring, not scary, or show the same same scenes, and to all the people who said these things about the movie have POOR taste in good movies, I waited 8 years for this movie and I'm not goons let some dumb critics that prefer cuties then this masterpiece stop me from giving this movie a 1,000,000,000/10 😠😠😤😤 To get something straight: This movie was made for the fans, NOT for people who are new to the series. 

If you have been a fan for any amount of time, you will adore this film. But whether or not you enjoyed the games, there is one thing that everyone can agree on: They absolutely nailed atmosphere. 

At any extent, you will at least have some fun watching this movie. It was great fun to watch with many little awesome moments for folks who are familiar with the lore. The gore and violence is more implied than shown due to the rating of the film, but it didnt take away from the experience, although more visible gore would've made it more enjoyable as a horror. the plot holes and unanswered questions are to be expected from fnaf but i felt the story was well put together and didn't come off as confusing. the practical effects and animatronics were the highlight of the film, they look amazing and their movement was spot on. the critics have their heads jammed under sand for this one, its a fun time.

Horror,peeping_tom_1960,95,85,"It’s a horror classic of the highest order, a piece of master filmmaking by an iconic artist at the top of his game. The film remains dangerous and brilliant... A feverish cult object among horror acolytes and classic film buffs alike.  [Michael Powell] did not write Peeping Tom; but he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for this essentially vicious film.  A masterclass in filmmaking that puts a sociopath in a sympathetic light. Uncomfortable but compelling, Peeping Tom is not to be missed.  This proto-slasher film is making fascinating observations about class, nationality and gender, but it's so well integrated it never feels heavy handed. Powell's meta shooting style is inspired and Vivian Shearer makes a big impression in only 2 scenes. Mark who is the peeping tom in this situation is probably up there with one of the most complex characters in cinema. Directed by Michael Powell with British Anarchy ... crazy but exquisitely reserved. Recognized now as one of his greatest films, a primer for the use of the camera as an eye and point of view. We are all voyeurs when we watch a movie Almost all who act as voyeurs in their love of cinema will never hurt another person- not fatally, anyway. That doesn't mean we aren't irreparably altered by our voyeurism. A timeless and sublime masterpiece that presents an incredibly intelligent and moving picture of psychological struggle. An integral film for the development of the horror genre. Peeping Tom didn't make me want to streak out of the cinema shrieking, as Franju's film did at times; it gives me the creeps in retrospect, in my heart and mind more than in my eyes. Carl Boehm must be credited with a portrayal whose discretion has probably saved the film from its own worst excesses of morbidity. So many movies about the most depraved of life-takers also function as therapies for their audiences; this one makes us accessories to deplorable deeds, and rejects all opportunities to find relief from them. It is now justly recognized as a classic of its disturbing kind, treating its material with a restraint, seriousness, and compassion that many of today's filmmakers could learn from. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is the best movie ever made about the voyeuristic allure of making and watching movies. Fear, as it turns out, is the most frightening thing in the world, and Peeping Tom makes us feel it palpably as few films have been able to do. Although seemingly about a creep who kills, it is as much about our own ","Irredeemably awful and, for what is supposed to be a legendary cinematic groundbreaker, is more boring than sitting in the dentist's waiting room and as entertaining as cleaning the cat litter box.

Powell: yes, the legend who brought us ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and ""The Red Shoes"" (which, as a former ballet dancer and later a balletmaster, remains a personal favourite).  But … a decade or two later and the trademarks have not matured: retina-burning oversaturated colours, over-staged blocking (he's what'cha call an auteur, ain't he?), and mindboggling, dreadful acting down the line (OK – I liked the brief dance/murder sequence with Moira Shearer, but the choreography looked like something Mary Tyler Moore did on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" in the same era).

Karlheinz Böhm (whose main attribute is that he is a son of Karl Böhm, one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century and a Nazi collaborator; he did his post-war time and went on to conduct until he could barely lift the baton) seems to be aping Peter Lorre and has all the charisma of a public lavatory floor.

And he is just one among a sea of zombies.

I am extremely disappointed: I was led on for decades about what a masterpiece it was, and now that I finally catch up with it (thank you, Criterion; can I please get my money back?), I am hugely disappointed on every possible level.

To suggest this was ""groundbreaking"" and ""ahead of its time"" is pure heresy.  Kindly have a look at what a true auteur was doing around 1960: watch some Goddard (up to 1967) and Truffaut and anybody from the nouvelle vague, some Visconti and Bertolucci, some Fellini, some Kurosawa and Teshigahara, some Buñuel, some Kubrick, some … OK.  You get the idea. There's much to admire, technically at least, if not in other aspects too, in Michael Powell's film, which many consider as the first slasher film. The location shots are like visual records of 1960s London while Powell's fluid camerawork is dramatic, informative and creative. Leo Marks' chilling screenplay about Carl Boehm's Mark Lewis, a shy, camera-obsessed young man who murders prostitutes and actresses in order to capture on film their last moments of fear, is also ahead of its time if only in its inclusion of the killer's backstory to make him more human and sympathetic. However, at the same time ironically, it's hard not to find this all a bit dated as well, especially with the modern audience's considerably desensitized palate, both regarding nudity and violence to","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.8764887452125549, 'Negative': 0.01780661754310131, 'Neutral': 0.006810806691646576, 'Mixed': 0.09889386594295502}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'e312b0b8-fdf9-4530-a253-459201d2f552', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'e312b0b8-fdf9-4530-a253-459201d2f552', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '163', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:25 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.012290910817682743, 'Negative': 0.6289188861846924, 'Neutral': 0.02011164091527462, 'Mixed': 0.3386785686016083}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '0c1ae46a-1f0a-49bd-af26-7e2b265e89fb', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '0c1ae46a-1f0a-49bd-af26-7e2b265e89fb', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '162', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:29 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.8764887452125549,0.01780661754310131,0.006810806691646576,0.09889386594295502,POSITIVE,0.012290910817682743,0.6289188861846924,0.02011164091527462,0.3386785686016083,NEGATIVE
Horror,a_creature_was_stirring,50,38,"The film has a great cast, direction, set pieces, creature design, and holiday lighting, but first time screenwriter Shannon Wells' ending torpedoes the whole thing. It's worth checking out, but oof. While smartly relying more on its performance and chemistry than creature carnage or gore (although what’s here is suitably grisly), A Creature Was Stirring can’t overcome the limitations that constantly undercut the promise of its title.
 The trajectory of the narrative may be predictable, but the storyline is enjoyably dark. Unfortunately, though, the conclusion is mangled by ridiculously cheap and lazy editing, breaking any discomfort that had been created. A Creature Was Stirring provides enough good things to be worth watching overall. Feel free to laugh at the sheer height of the concept, but be glad that neither the actors nor the director do so. Psychological chills, creature thrills, and family dysfunction become this unfocused commentary on the looming specter of addiction. The unclear nature of the rules and mythology of the horror of A Creature Was Stirring becomes increasingly frustrating as the movie progresses. A Creature Was Stirring is not revenge of a beast story or an attack of a spirit but a human frailty of a secret that literally consumes a mind, a suitcase, and life. “A Creature Was Stirring” has an interesting take on human frailty, but it’s really the stuff of short films, with LaVeck visibly struggling to stretch the story to a longer run time. A Creature Was Stirring does not ignore the more visceral scares. There are some impressive special effects that range from scary to just plain disgusting. The monster is based on something that is terrifying in its own right but rarely seen in horror.","This holiday horror film tries to do too much and devolves into a chaotic nightmare. Had hopes it was going to be a Christmas horror movie, the only thing Christmas about it was the colors with thrown in candy canes. The movie was so bad and made zero sense. The big finale would've made it somewhat worth it had there been implications throughout the movie instead of being super rushed the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. Just watch something else! Would of been better as a short story, this one is very passable. A film that falls flat on its face.

Action,godzilla_minus_one,98,98,"You definitely feel for all these characters and and the choices that they make, and that adds a surprising amount of like emotional heft to what could have just been a thrilling but a purely exciting escapist action film. Director Takashi Yamazaki captures the essence of the traditional MonsterVerse and elevates it to a monumental new level, resulting in the best Godzilla film in decades. [Full Review in Spanish] This really shows Hollywood how it's done. Godzilla Minus One delivers a disaster epic worthy of the character’s legacy. Godzilla Minus One’s opening moments feature some of the most impressively visceral Godzilla action in recent years. If Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters left you wanting more Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One scratches that itch and then some.  Has a much better grasp of both storytelling and action filmmaking than probably 95 percent of what Hollywood has been churning out lately Godzilla Minus One is a breathtaking tour-de-force for the power of cinema itself, a much-needed reminder of how good it feels to sit in a movie theater when studios actually invest in work that respects the humanity of its audience. Action trumps meaning and symbolism, but it's still a rollicking ol' time. It puts the trauma of history at the very centre of the story, ultimately crafting a story about human beings pulling together to heal and defeat an inexplicable force of destruction. Godzilla Minus One is not only one of the best films out of the 30-plus in the series, but also one of the best films of the year. The acting is superb, the destruction is immense and incredible, and the gnarly Godzilla design is fantastic. Mercifully, the film takes a light-touch approach to using its star as an off-the-peg allegory for processing historical trauma, delivering instead blockbuster thrills... The best fantasy action film of the year. Yamazaki’s film is an artful, bar-setting, barrier-shattering, near masterpiece in the guise of a behemoth blockbuster. Godzilla Minus One is one of the strongest blockbusters of 2023, a movie I could see easily smashing its way onto my best of the year list.  ... organic, heartbreaking, and cheer-worthy... an unholy marriage between Dunkirk and Jaws served up with a side of raw courage... incredible film in addition to being a great Godzilla movie. It's monstrously entertaining. In a year plagued by a bunch of disappointing tentpole releases, Godzilla's triumphant return to the big screen should be proof enough that there is no suc","One of the most awe inspiring films in recent memory. Beautiful cinematography, great effects in relation to Godzilla and the carnage it delivers. Beautifully done script with a plot not over simplified or complex but enough to feel invested in the outcome of its characters. 

As a life long Godzilla fan, this film has a right to stand alongside the original, if not surpass it. What a film. History movies fan will love it. Monster movie fans will love it. Solid story fans will love it. So good and deserves more and more eyes on it. I am fresh out of Watching this and my gosh did it not disappoint. the Hype is real and this puts the American movies to shame! only with 15million USD Budget and they created this masterpiece. this may be the best movie of 2023 and the best godzilla movie ever to come out. the ending is crazy and the twists and u feel the raw emotions of the characters plud are actually interesting. Such a f**king great film!! Too much dialogue for me. But the Godzilla scenes was dope wish it was more. I kind of liked it. gorgeous movie with an enthralling human cast that drive the story beautifully It's a remake of an old Japanese horror film and has English subtitles. We were blown away because the backstory makes this a new classic in this genre. I would highly recommend the Theatre due to action and easy to read subtitles I can't think of a better Godzilla movie currently than this one, it's so groundbreaking and powerful. Usually the human story sucks but the in where compels the movie to a level not even the original one could do, this is an eye opener for many and I can't recommend it enough. Such a great movie and it brings back to fear factor for Godzilla that we haven't seen since Shin Godzilla and the original 1954 one. Please go and watch it it's genuinely beats every Hollywood film this year. Never cried watching a Godzilla movie.
The surprise ending got me good 🥹. 
The love interest who was thought to be dead is revealed to be alive. Brutal, ground shaking, heart pounding & terrifying ""Godzilla Minus One"" is simply stunning. 
An emotional edge of your seat tale of Postwar Japan, critical of their own government actions & struggling with lost while unable to leave the war behind & now in search of redemption to escape the nightmares they witnessed when having to face another world destroying force.

Action,the_hunger_games_the_ballad_of_songbirds_and_snakes,64,89,"Set sixty-four years before the triumph of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the clever screenplay reflects the violence assimilated by the culture. [Full Review in Spanish] The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is more focused on delivering Easter eggs with the subtlety of a sledgehammer than developing these characters. It leaves us with nearly three hours of brand revival. The fun performances by a game cast can't make up for poor pacing and a bloated runtime that feels wholly unearned. It’s still just a slightly modernized, teen-oriented take on ""Rollerball"" or “The Running Man.” THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES is an incredible extension of the series, both in terms of structure and theme. A reasonably compelling narrative about a conflicted young man, a man torn between his ambitious nature and his moral compass and feelings for a charming and beautiful young woman. [R]evisiting the original series’ ideas and themes leads to diminishing dramatic and emotional returns, but as a case study in authoritarian politics, [this film] remains as relevant today as it was fifteen years ago when the first novel was published. An entertaining installment that may not be quite as good as the originals, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes definitely stands on its own merits and charm. Were we champing at the bit to learn how Donald Sutherland’s Machiavellian President Coriolanus Snow schemed his way to power in the years before the original The Hunger Games Needs no more installments. Years after the young-adult dystopia genre crested and flattened, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is here to remind us of what we are missing: not much. The best film in the series — but that’s still not saying much. The action scenes remain well-shot and tightly edited, and even without the provocative political energy of the Katniss years, the cultural parallels between Panem’s world and ours retain their unsettling power. ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a film of contrasts — visually stunning yet narratively uneven, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the origins of Panem, but not without stumbling over its own ambitious intentions. I do not buy it philosophically for one second. It is very long and sometimes unwieldy, but in the hands of director Francis Lawrence... I think fans will like it. It delivers mostly the high notes you expect from a film of this sort. A standout leading lady isn't quite en","This movie seemed really chaotic to me, like there was too much going on and yet I still feel like I didn't understand Snow's character development into the evil guy he becomes. Maybe it would have been better if we knew his inner dialogue but it just seemed so random some of his decision-making. Also, one of my favorite parts of the hunger games movies is the actual games and that was not as big of a part in this movie as I had hoped for. After that it felt like it dragged on. It was nice to have more background on the games but it does not compare to the originals for me. This was a beautifully done movie and a great one to see in the theater as I think the big screen adds so much to the experience. The book this is based on covers a lot of ground and I think this movie did a fantastic job at captures it all. When reading the book most of this movie is what I imagined so I count that as a job well done. The issues I have with the movie's story is the same issues I had with the book, so you cannot really fault the movie as it is simply the source material. Overall I loved it! Best Hunger Games movie ! Fantastic characters, with a very good story, but it can be a long film after the end of an event! If you're a fan of the original films, this prequel does a fantastic job of setting up the world and characters. I wasn't very familiar with the original films going into the film, but I got a decent idea of what's in store for me when I decide to watch them. The first half, for me, was the highlight of the film. You should watch if you liked the first hunger games or have read the books. Acting was halfway decent. Worst hunger game by far! So lame almost fell asleep 👎 It really did just pass the time.

Too much of anything is not healthy. Same goes for Rachel Zegler; she is a good actress, and an even better singer, but she is frustrating to watch pretty much all of the time. This movie, was pretty frustrating to watch all of the time. I'm not a huge hunger games fan, but man this one for me was all about taking my wife to the cinema so she could watch it, and literally nothing more. The original movies were way better. The ending was very underwhelming and irritatingly rushed and there are large chunks of the movie where people aren't doing or saying anything. It's probably because I'm not a huge HGs fan like I said, either way, this was meh for me. Kept waiting for it to get better but it just kept getting worse.

Action,silent_night_2023,58,50,"Those wanting a John Woo return will have to wait. Unfortunately, Silent Night is too bland, boring, and poorly made to bring him back to the mainstream. Strikes the perfect balance between intense action sequences and equally commanding emotional moments to create a stunning film that fires on all cylinders. This film reunites us with an old teacher who has become a competent imitator of his students. [Full review in Spanish] It is worth noting the poor aim that gang members have in general, and against Brian in particular. [Full review in Spanish] Narratively, there's something missing here but once it gets going, the action is there; it holds your attention.  The new movie feels too simple for him [Woo], a thriller with only vengeance on its brain. Great for those who just want action, action, action and don't care about character development. While the Chinese-Hong Kong filmmaker returns with a fairly minor film... there are a few self-tributes and a handful of pure tense-filled scenes that allow us to remember the good (best) times in Woo's cinema with a smile. [Full review in Spanish] Silent Night is a collection of parts that never become the film the trailer promises, or the film I think Woo intended. And yet, for the occasional flourish of the old mad genius that survives here, I'm still glad I saw it on a big screen. A curious experience: an action thriller with sequences of brutal violence, which tries to justify the actions of its protagonist in the most sentimental way possible. Full review in Spanish. Silent Night will not teach anyone anything, but I found it a highly watchable, if subpar work from a master filmmaker. That’s not a recommendation, but for some of you, the message should be clear. If you can stomach the first act as an interesting and flawed creative experiment and enjoy revenge stories with bloody denouements, though, there’s still something to enjoy here by the time the credits roll. Just don’t expect much from it. Blood spurts forth in great volume as the bullets criss-cross the frame, yet Woo manages to keep focus on his anti-hero’s humanity and motive...a ripping action drama.  It's bad, but at least it's also super depressing. If you think I care that you might see spoilers in this review, then you completely underestimate my utter contempt for this movie.

Me quedé dormido la mayor parte del tiempo, nunca pensé que en una ya que soy un ignorante en el cine; pero que parte tan importante son los diálogos y la música.
Yo sé que se llama venganza silenciosa en México pero era demasiado el silencio que me daba amnsiedad y sin una buena música que acompañara al pobre actor decadente se sentía un gran vacío. 
Rescatable unas pocas escenas de acción. Se sentían más en los sentimientos del mudito, cuando uno va por la venganza y la sed de sangre que habría de tener el anglosajón pero quedó a deberme mucho. Poorly written mediocre acting -- not at all what we expected from John Woo.  Took WAY too long to set the characters and story up,  The action scenes in the trailer are pretty much it.   By about the tenth time he plays the music box people in the theatre were openly groaning.  One of the people in the couple next to us was sound asleep at the end. The movie had good and bad parts. what we did not like about the movie's ending was how he died and the cop died. it should have ended where someone found them they both ended up in the hospital and that's how the movie should have ended where they were okay. I HAVE NEVER WALKED OUT OF A MOVIE UNTIL TODAY.  Dude I know the movie is called silent night BUT DAMN, most movies are called certain things… and not ACTUALLY relate to the title. I mean nooOooo one SPOKE the entire movie. All I heard was the guy next to me eat his candy. Total SILENCE. JEEZ MAN, but you BET I walked out of that theater and watched another. Excellent movie with a spot on effect to fit the title. Wow. That was an hour and half of my life I will not get back. I get it he can no longer speak but his wife won't ether? Zero dialog. My mail man could be the star in this movie. No talent needed, Unrealistic and poor directing. Waste of my time and money. An excellent John Woo action film. Full of explosions and shooting. Don’t expect any talking. This is John Woo doing what he does with his craft!!! It’s ok but Wait til this comes out on free tv. This movie had a great script and the acting as great. This is must see movie done by John Woo Ignore the negative reviews. Yes, it’s true there was no dialogue in this flick but that doesn’t mean it was a ‘silent movie.’ There was background music and some police radio chatter. Had I not read the reviews, I’m not sure I’d have realized there was no person to person dialogue.

Action,the_marvels,61,83,"It's not Marvelous.  The Marvels neglects to fulfill the most basic tenets of being its own movie.  The Marvels is a perfectly fine superhero flick - sitting amongst a rocky at best Phase Four and a one for two score so far in the latest Phase. A pedal-to-the-medal and often humorous adventure that serves as a sequel to both the 2019 movie Captain Marvel and the 2020 MCU Disney+ series Ms. Marvel. I feel like they played it ""safe"", which significantly lowered the stakes for me. I loved the short running time but this movie struggled to find its footing.  This is far from the worst MCU film. It's actually quite charming and had some fun fight scenes. But tonally it was all over the place. Shout out to Iman Vellani who is incredible.  Inconsistent, interminable - and silly! It could have been a lot worse.  The primary plot lines are fun, yet they can also be confusing, and at times it becomes a little too much--although totally enjoyed the three lead girls working together. It's not going to win over people that are on the fence... but it's not bad. The Marvels is a diverting, easy to digest cosmic adventure that zips by at a breakneck pace and reminds us of the importance of family and friendship. Brie Larson leads a super-trio that works hard to blast some fun into this confusing adventure.

 “The Marvels” delivers a fun, well-paced superhero movie anchored by three solid, charismatic performances.   Oh boy, I am so tired of the MCU... Now it's the same film over and over and over again.  This is false sophistication, especially in this case, when it covers up the visual ineptitude and chaos of The Marvels.  The whole ""Captain Marvel"" franchise is diluted and shredded in this average action thriller. [The Marvels] feels like the finale to a season of television we never got, and perhaps a series would have given each of these characters the time they needed to fully explore each of their individual issues. It’s all rather standard superhero sci-fi ... with the welcome variation that almost all of the key characters are women. Vellani is funny and sweet as Kamala, an unabashed Captain Marvel fangirl who doesn’t hide her excitement at joining the fray.  If Marvel is trying to win back audience enthusiasm, centering its characters and a sense of fun is the right approach. And teaming up with talented directors like Nia DaCosta goes a long way on executing that approach It's not a disaster—it's too entertaining and too well-acted to be that. I loved how imagin","Had heard mixed reviews so decided to give this a go. Rather disappointed as it's not like the other movies at all, there's an expectation people will have watched some of the TV series (I'm assuming)?.. no idea which ones.

Anyway, it flies into it at the start with no introduction to any characters and the rest of it is a hot mess of things that again seem to require previous knowledge one or more TV series to understand what the hell is going on or who the characters are.

Should be a 0.5 star review, but I've upgraded to 1.5 as Brie Larson (seemingly) hasn't got the stick up her arse anymore. I found this movie to be an exciting, evenly paced super hero movie. There was nothing exceptional about it, but also nothing at all bad. If you want a fun evening of stepping into the world of Marvel with some beloved characters and some new ones introduced then I think it fits the bill. The Marvels had its ups and downs, but overall, it's a good movie. I honestly believe it was better than the first one. The Brie larson, Teyonah , and Iman were great 🔥🔥🔥 The villains master plan is plot ripped of from Spaceballs. Might as well be watching spaceballs instead of this. Although at times there were a couple of pacing issues, but the film does have some great moments especially from Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan who stood out. Snoozefest of marvellous proportions. This is not the greatest Marvel film ever made but it is by no means a target for people saying it is the worst. It is a fun film and that I believe was the whole point. If there is a fault in the film it resides in having so many characters to reconcile and then a sort of ham-fisted plot which attempts to bring it all together.
The glowing star of this film is Iman Vellani. Her straight up fan-girling may get annoying to some at times but that is sort of the point. Her enthusiasm alone makes me love her. Larson gets a bad wrap I feel sometimes. I think she has a crafty level to her acting that people just sort of ignore because they think she isn't a nice person. Get over it. She is a talent and worthy of this character and more. 
Basically this is a fun, entertaining popcorn flick that isn't out to reinvent the wheel but simply exists to make people smile and what in the world is wrong with that? It feels like the end of an era with Marvel. The movie isn't good but it's not that bad either. A bit disjointed and juvenile, but the movie was actually pretty good. I tried.

Action,die_hard,94,94,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top. Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them. That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday. The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered. Give Die Hard a fresh spin this year; it's the most joyous Christmas film of all!  I really appreciated the interpersonal relationship between him and his wife. It wasn't slow but it was taking its time. [It] may be the best action movie EVER. It's another anti-cheer holiday selection, but one that keeps on giving - rewatchable sans saturation... Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels. Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you."" Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable. A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn. The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming. The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish] It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen. Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together. Die Hard still feels as fresh and thril","Great to see a classic on the big screen the way it was intended. I hadn't seen this movie until it was offered in the Dolby theater at my local AMC. It was awesome! Such a fun story with crazy fun dialogue and action. Loved it. all time action great Where does the ambulance come from? Why does the elevator explode? I just had the good fortune to see an original print on the big screen, and this movie is still as fun the 20th time as it is the first. Sure it plays heavy on 80s heavy action, comeback lines and buddy chemistry, but nothing beats seeing a vulnerable, grade A Bruce taking out Rickman and his henchman one by one while having a few fun twists along the way. I have seen this movie so many times and it never gets old! I love Die Hard! It is a timeless classic! Loved seeing this classic on the big screen! one of the best Xmas Movies there is! Merry Christmas everyone!!!! This is the way to enjoy a movie. What movies used to be like. Fun. Third Best Christmas Movie ever made, right behind A Christmas Carol (Alastair Sim) and A Christmas Story but just ahead of Scrooged and Christmas Vacation! First time watching and wow, they just don’t make movies like this anymore. Was a cool watch in theaters, and I will always consider this a Christmas movie no matter what A towering achievement! One of my all time favorite action films Great action movie from start to finish. Funny one liners. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are perfect playing good and bad guys. It's just my opinion but this is not a Christmas movie. It takes place during Christmas but it's not about Christmas. Last thing, yippee-ki-yay mutha f@cker! Best of the best. A tense and exciting action thriller for even the causal popcorn flick movie goes. Willis and cast are incredible all the way through. And yes it is a Christmas movie. classic for a reason ... this movie does not disappoint! A Christmas Classic and even better on the big screen!!! It's not only an action classic and a Christmas movie, but it's one of the best action movies period.

Action,fast_charlie,86,84,"Phillip Noyce’s well-seasoned, blood-splattered throwback, a smooth ride that doesn’t wear out its welcome at a brisk 90 minutes. In addition to setting the scene gorgeously on the Gulf Coast, director Phillip Noyce knows how to keep things moving slickly. And he also finds ways to reveal internal motivations in characters even when things get silly. A weird noir that has so many permutations that even when you see them coming, they're italicized so you feel fondly towards all the tropes.  Pierce Brosnan drops his Irish elocution for a Southern twang in a breezy crime thriller with unexpected dark humor. Fast Charlie isn't extraordinary but has solid action, good cast chemistry, and enough macabre chuckles to warrant a recommendation. “Fast Charlie” doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, but it’s the sort of engaging escapade that Hollywood used to turn out with ease.  The movie adds little that's new to the tough-guy redemption genre — apart from a dead raccoon and some tasty tomato sauce — but it does revolve around the always likable Pierce Brosnan, who plays the courtly but dangerous Charlie Swift. Brosnan brings his brand of sly, flirtatious, reluctant heroism to the role. He and Baccarin make a good May/December pairing. Caan's last film. Talented collaborators on both sides of the camera have done better than this far-fetched Deep South crime thriller, although it intermittently rises above the formulaic fray. This is the farthest thing in the cinematic firmament from a world-changer you can imagine, but as an evening’s entertainment, it’ll more than do. The fact that Brosnan and Baccarin make us believe ... their ... strange relationship ... makes the material feel less routine than it could have been. The real motor that sustains Fast Charlie for the duration of its breezy 90-minute running time is the will-they won’t-they romance between Brosnan and Baccarin, both actors cultivating a palpable sense of intimacy. Feels like reheated Elmore Leonard leftovers. “Fast Charlie” doesn’t jump off the screen, but it’s an engaging ride with morally dubious people trying to figure out a future that isn’t guaranteed. An exhilarating, suspenseful and wickedly funny action thriller. Pierce Brosnan is at his best.  We’ve seen plenty of cinematic aging hitmen looking to retire to a more peaceful life before, but thanks to Brosnan’s ageless charm and a subtly rendered love story underpinning the proceedings, we’ve never rooted for one quite as much. Phillip N","good film about a man and his choices. his loyalty to his friends and methods never changes and those who he befriends learn that they can rely and trust him. this story has been told billions of times but still holds you till the end. a good moving story, don't be afraid, watch it. Great cast, very entertaining movie. Just barely not a waste of time. Very enjoyable and fun to watch. I thought this was a good movie.  It had some interesting characters, a decent plot, and some good action scenes.  Some of the lines were excellent.  I'm happy I rented and did not purchase it. You are not supposed to find tenderness and quiet dignity in a gangster movie.   Hell, for that matter, unless you are of the life, you shouldn't see yourself in a gangster movie, and yet the gift of Fast Charlie is you will find great tenderness and dignity in the film, and find yourself front and center in the film around a kitchen table.

Let me back up.

The Charlie of the title is Charlie Swift, played by Pierce Brosnan.  Unless you have lived under a rock for forty years, you know this man is the dictionary definition of tenderness and quiet dignity.  He acts when he plays a hitman, and he does so here with brilliance.  Like a diamond (also known for its brilliance) Charlie's role as a fixer has many facets, one of which is a hitman.  There is a sharp, cold, precision to how Charlie kills, swift even, and no, you don't want to see him a suit in the morning.  Just ask a not so sharp fellow who thinks his name is Blade, but really is better to suited to being a donut.  Oh wait, you can't, Donut is dead.

Donut's death, and the death of the man Donut and Charlie were hired to kill is what drives the plot of Fast Charlie but the film itself exists in the complicated and multifaceted space that we call humanity. 

It is another facet of Charlie, that of a caregiver, that we the audience find ourselves in the film.  We have been at those birthday parties celebrating the ringleader of our crew.  We have stood around kitchen tables figuring out how to help take care of someone we love.  We have asked someone out on a date and instantly cringed as our heart circumvents our mouths.    We may dream of being the badass Charlie is; we are the person he is.

We are also Marcie, played with equal diamond like composition by Morena Baccarin.   She lives her life fully, and her life is full of a past that almost prevents her future.  Almost.   Luckily fate crafts a new ending for her just as deser","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9128479361534119, 'Negative': 0.002924520755186677, 'Neutral': 0.07945514470338821, 'Mixed': 0.004772357642650604}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'daa08e5f-33e1-4357-a6b0-108566773497', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'daa08e5f-33e1-4357-a6b0-108566773497', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '164', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:26 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9996412992477417, 'Negative': 5.6683915317989886e-05, 'Neutral': 0.00015254211029969156, 'Mixed': 0.00014947031741030514}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '4d344eae-69f2-4f07-b717-6c617e903d22', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '4d344eae-69f2-4f07-b717-6c617e903d22', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '168', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:30 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.9128479361534119,0.002924520755186677,0.07945514470338821,0.004772357642650604,POSITIVE,0.9996412992477417,5.6683915317989886e-05,0.00015254211029969156,0.00014947031741030514,POSITIVE
Action,concrete_utopia,100,79,"Concrete Utopia remains emotionally convincing despite being ideologically hollow. Director Um is nothing if not fiercely committed to his dystopian gimmick, for better or worse, and his actors follow suit.  A natural disaster of such magnitude might never happen, but a societal one as depicted here increasingly seems too close for any comfort. Concrete Utopia is hardly the first disaster movie in which panic trumps morality. But this vision of a “utopia” smashed to pieces is more disturbing and believable than most. Combines the actual disaster, in frightening & realistic effects, with the disaster of losing humanity in the face of the extreme circumstance. It’s beyond whether the strong will survive, it wonders if decency will also prevail. With director interview. Reels us in, jolts and even shocks us and gets the viewer thinking, at least a little.  Concrete Utopia mostly hits on familiar themes, but it executes them so well—and with a healthy dash of the dark, satirical flavor that made Parasite and Squid Game so deliciously enjoyable—that you’ll easily find yourself not minding too much. It's a powerful movie, very well-made and well-directed with a contemporary resonance. Though the humor and acting in “Concrete Utopia” can occasionally feel broad, Lee’s viscerally monstrous performance grounds a high-stakes drama.  This polished, character-driven drama is a whole lot of movie, in both good and bad ways. While the film lacks the originality of many of the films it tries to emulate, it’s still a solidly crafted reminder of the absurdly tragic fate that our current housing system appears to be guiding us towards.  Concrete Utopia is an entertaining movie that explores the themes with surprising twists and turns by examining humanity’s perspective of good and evil people. “Concrete Utopia” is more ambitious than its execution, but nonetheless sustains its suspense with an emotional journey into the depths of what scarcity can do to humanity.  For those who don't understand that THE WALKING DEAD is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones, director Tae-hwa Eom and co-writer Lee Shin-ji's CONCRETE UTOPIA might be able to drive the point home. ""Triangle of Sadness"" meets ""Lord of the Flies"" in this entertaining post-apocalyptic disaster film that explores the class warfare and unchecked tribalism that’s rotting the heart of modern society.  With great production design, compelling performances all around, and a sufficiently layered script, it","Exceptional story-telling of a diaster-thriller film. In other films of the same genre typically the story takes place during a disaster with loaded action shows and heroic characters. Concrete Utopia focuses on the aftermath with a realistic portrayal of human nature in their quest for survival. best foreigh movie of the years Somewhat predictable plot twist but the beauty of the movie is how relatable and you would feel the characters' action is justified despite being ethically questionable. Like how can you be still sane during such an insane circumstances.
We feel the domino effect of one action leadings to reaction of many others. Most post apocalyptic movies show the survivors devolving into some weird religious or sci fi related cult.  This one is much more realistic, showing how people would actually react to the scenario.  This is a fascinating study of ordinary people dealing with incredibly trying circumstances.  Very well done. So well executed and well-acted I don't even care that it doesn't have anything new to offer. A very original idea but flawed with some gaping holes of logic.  Without giving up any spoilers, picture no electricity, and yet a family has a murdered corpse in a taped-up freezer and yet no one complains about the smell?  A building with a small population is somehow able to hold off a horde of 10s of thousands.  Suspended disbelief makes this movie enjoyable but must an audience be asked to do that? Plot and casting was good but the storyline is just 👎
The ending literally made it worst . The movie brilliantly delves into the moral quandary of survival in a post-apocalyptic world, posing the question of where to draw the line. Young Tak's character represents the extreme, willing to do whatever it takes, even at the expense of others, while Myeong Hwa embodies the pursuit of humanity, and Minseong grapples with the middle ground. Lee Byung Hun's acting is nothing short of terrifying, while Park Seo Jun shines. However, it's Park Bo Young who truly steals the show, delivering emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact. The film keeps you glued to the screen, and director Uhm Tae Hwa's genius move to blend psychological thriller and crime mystery elements with the post-apocalyptic setting makes this one of the best in its genre. Congratulations to the entire team for crafting a masterpiece. A post-apocalyptic thriller about the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, ""Concrete Utopia"" follows the story that begins when surv","{'Sentiment': 'NEGATIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.059766266494989395, 'Negative': 0.5146104693412781, 'Neutral': 0.060544054955244064, 'Mixed': 0.36507922410964966}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '344729cb-6a1f-4c1a-8d4e-7ff2a9526997', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '344729cb-6a1f-4c1a-8d4e-7ff2a9526997', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '164', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:26 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'POSITIVE', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.9379463791847229, 'Negative': 0.005512842908501625, 'Neutral': 0.032311148941516876, 'Mixed': 0.024229595437645912}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': 'e4ced52d-ebd7-493f-a53d-a0caceff0a70', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': 'e4ced52d-ebd7-493f-a53d-a0caceff0a70', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '165', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:30 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.059766266494989395,0.5146104693412781,0.060544054955244064,0.36507922410964966,NEGATIVE,0.9379463791847229,0.005512842908501625,0.032311148941516876,0.024229595437645912,POSITIVE

With that in mind, I'll give the film a B-, its not perfect, but if you settle in, you can enjoy one last adventure. Despite the weirdly ambivalent headlines and mixed reviews dogging this film since its bow at Cannes, this is one of the most consistently enjoyable legacy sequels of recent years. It’s fun; it’s wacky; it works. The final Indiana Jones entry is actually near the top of what is a usually dismal filmic phenomenon: closing chapters of long-running action vehicles. But what's missing is any sense of urgency in the story, or any sense of charisma from Ford himself. has enough throwback charm, humor, and attention to character that it comes close to earning its spot in a franchise that frankly should have ended with Indy riding off into the sunset in Last Crusade Without Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just a professional and innocuously pop-corn movie: a compilation of ""greatest hits"" by an emblematic character of a type of cinema that is fading away. [Full review in Spanish] It may have squiffy CG, a perhaps too extended opening, and repetitious set pieces of evasion and capture, but Mangold sticks the emotional and thematic landing ...  The acting throughout “Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny” is solid and the special effects are, as expected, state of the art. Composer John Williams is present for the musical thrills.
 This a movie for the nostalgia-minded. Between the score and extensive de-aging of Harrison Ford from 79 years to 37, it’s as if we weren’t 42 years from Raiders of the Lost Ark and we can almost feel like we’re watching installments filmed back to back. Dial of Destiny manages to be the complete opposite — the rare legacy sequel content with simply saying goodbye. Telling a poignant story about our relationship with nostalgia and how attempts to cling to the past prevent us from living in the present.
 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is cluttered and visually problematic, but never hopeless. The terrible final act torpedoes any chance of this film being deemed worthy of the franchise. The exaggerated plot that seems without rhyme or reason, prevents you from savoring it to the fullest. It may be the nostalgia of the well-thought-out movies of the saga, but ""The dial of destiny"" fails at that important point. {Full Review in Spanish}

 Considering the gravitas of Ford’s performance — which channels such profound grief — the disconnected","not as good as the first 3 solid film , better than crytal skull, solid acting and story , interesting story , not bad Buena película, pero no le llega ni a los talones a la trilogía original. Esta cinta es el cierre del personaje de Indiana Jones, por lo tanto tenia muchas expectativas en que le den un gran cierre a este icónico personaje, y en mi opinión se lo dieron pero podría haber sido mucho mejor por algunos aspectos que no me convencieron. Lo principal es que la película es bastante larga, y en algunos momentos se me hizo algo pesada y no es tan fácil de ver como las cuatro anteriores; no me parece aburrida pero siento que en las otras películas pasaban mas cosas para mantener un ritmo algo mas fresco y entretenido. La secuencia inicial con Indy joven se me hizo espectacular, es una aventura digna del personaje y lo único que le noto malo es el rejuvenecimiento, ya que si bien no esta para nada mal se nota bastante y hasta parece un videojuego. En general los efectos no son la gran cosa, están bien en algunos momentos pero también hay escenas que se ven bastante mal. El cierre de la película incluyendo viajes en el tiempo me pareció fantástico, ya que nunca creí ver esto en una película de Indiana Jones y era una de las cosas que le faltaba a la franquicia. Otra cosa a comentar es el personajes de Helena, el cual me pareció de lo peor de la película, no me gusto para nada, es insoportable y hasta odioso, tratando mal a nuestro icónico protagonista y queriendo siempre ser protagonista. Además, el personaje de Teddy se me hizo algo innecesario, es una especie de Tapón pero menos carismático. Por otro lado, no me gusto lo que hicieron con el personaje de Mutt, creo que era un personaje con el que podían hacer mucho mas y le podían dejar el legado de Indy a alguien tan importante como a su hijo, haciéndolo un mejor personaje en comparación con lo visto en la cuarta entrega. También, me gustaron mucho las referencias a cintas anteriores y las vueltas de los personajes de Sallah y Marion. Por ultimo, los villanos no son la gran cosa, el villano principal esta bastante bien pero no al nivel de los anteriores de la franquicia, y sus secuaces como Klaber son algo decepcionantes y son uno mas del montón. En cuanto al final, se me hizo muy emotivo, ya que creo que es un gran cierre para el personaje, y me encanto la vuelta de Marion para darle un final ""feliz"" a Indy, ya que a pesar de haber tenido una vida difícil pudo seguir adelante en parte gracias a su e","{'Sentiment': 'MIXED', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.08289571106433868, 'Negative': 0.006876968313008547, 'Neutral': 0.004911924712359905, 'Mixed': 0.9053153991699219}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '393ca760-ef88-4698-8840-561109af34d2', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '393ca760-ef88-4698-8840-561109af34d2', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '161', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:26 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}","{'Sentiment': 'MIXED', 'SentimentScore': {'Positive': 0.0039025803562253714, 'Negative': 0.05489574372768402, 'Neutral': 0.000556554296053946, 'Mixed': 0.9406452178955078}, 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '22c30c33-c22b-43a5-8804-b0610eb71c8f', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'x-amzn-requestid': '22c30c33-c22b-43a5-8804-b0610eb71c8f', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '161', 'date': 'Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:05:30 GMT'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}",0.08289571106433868,0.006876968313008547,0.004911924712359905,0.9053153991699219,MIXED,0.0039025803562253714,0.05489574372768402,0.000556554296053946,0.9406452178955078,MIXED
