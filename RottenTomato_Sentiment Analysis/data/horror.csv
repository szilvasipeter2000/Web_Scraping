Horror,thanksgiving_2023,"Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' is macabre, bloody and unexpectedly funny. The director takes slasher brutality to a new level to tell a story that is already iconic among horror fans. [Full Review in Spanish]
 The real villain in this is American consumerism.  Nonetheless, in the times of horror films with elaborate twists, a return to a conventional narrative structure is gratifying. [Full review in Spanish] With stronger plotting and characters worth rooting for, this raucously amusing but forgettable genre carve-up might have stirred more gratitude. I appreciate good practical effects, and that's what we get in this movie. Gory and often unpleasant, Thanksgiving follows the rules of the slasher genre and not much else. [Full review in Spanish] Roth mustered all his energy into this effort. Armed with everything he learned over his career, Roth‚Äôs positioned to make the next great holiday horror classic. The structure and killer reveal are a little wonky, and at times it feels like Roth and Jeff Rendell are trying to shoe horn in elements from the faux trailer, but the kills are solid and the vibe is very fun A gory good time that doesn't aspire to be anything more than a fun slasher, a goal that it wholeheartedly achieves. This is an insane experience but in the best way. This over-the-top kill-fest sticks to its guns until the very end and provides some memorable thrills along the way. The protagonists blend together and feel unmemorable, but the tone is consistent. The film's well-executed (pun intended) thrills make it a feast.  ...a passable endeavor that generally does feel like it should be much, much better. This gory slasher movie is happily absent director Eli Roth's former cruel, misogynistic touches, taking instead a playful, self-aware approach that's both fun and darkly funny.  Yes, the premise is silly, but the movie knows it, winking at the audience with absurd scenarios and over-the-top gore. It is more attuned to contemporary trauma than any other movie. This horror flick about modern obscenity helps us see it for ourselves. It's a fun movie to see with a crowd. This does what it does really well, and I had a good time. This festive special is grisly laughs done just right. A new film to be thankful for. Thanksgiving not only pays homage to, and, at the same time, parodies the classic slasher, but brings it to the era of the iPhone and social networks. [Full review in Spanish]","Skip. It was extremely pitiful This was everything you want in a silly slasher film. I loved that it did not take itself too seriously and just when things got a bit ""scary"" something would happen that also made you laugh which is a delicate balance which this movie pulled off well. I do think it came with a little bit extra gore just for the sake of gore that did not really advance the story though. Overall solid campy movie that tied a bow on the Thanksgiving turkey in a way that does not seem like Thanksgiving 2 is imminent. Loved it, great story, great kills, a new horror icon is born. Thanksgiving was the most creative horror movies I've seen, while also keeping the 90s slasher feel. I also really liked the mystery aspect to it, and the way they tied Thanksgiving themes to the movie, was very clever. This movie was an instant thanksgiving classic. Why show horror when the world falls in love at this time of year. Poor choice perhaps ü§î Amei cada segundo, qualidade demaisssssss starts out with a good premise but gets really bad after that and you're supposed to be able to figure out who the bad guy is there is almost no way that you would ever be able to figure out who it is The holiday is the hook, but this is just another movie about a psycho killing teenagers (and not very realistically).  There is no suspense or originality here. Honestly this movie wasn't great. Expected so much more from Eli Roth. Truly disappointed. It was like a C- scream film. Loved it; not at all what I was thinking it was going to be. Good story, though I did predict the ending half way through‚Ä¶ very good. Decent holiday slasher. I like terror and even horror movies but this one crossed the line . This was a disgusting and bloody movie. Cannot qualify as entertainment at all. it was boring, nothing original nor new about this. I might as well call it a comedy. Good kills and very nice makeup.
The effects can be weird at times and the cuts to straight, but the creativity with the plot and gruesome deaths makes up for it! I loved the movie. It kept me interested from the beginning to the end. It is really a must see!!! I really hope it's a part 2!!! üòÉüòÉüòÉ I loooooooved this movie!! It kept me from beginning to end. I hope there's a part 2!! kinda weird literally It's everything I want from a slasher movie. Very fun and funny! Also brutal as hell! Bem violento e sanguinario. Feriado sangrento tem personagens totalmente esqueviceis, mas que compensar pelo gore A good slasher movie to watch, but I've already seen better ones ü©∏"
Horror,dream_scenario,"'Dream Scenario' by director Kristoffer Borgli and starring Nicolas Cage, explores instant celebrity and also, mass hatred. All through an allegory of celebrity with surrealistic overtones. [Full Review in Spanish]
 It rides on the success of the right performer pulling it off, and the actor‚Äôs own public persona helps‚Äîseasoned movie watchers know to expect something beyond the ordinary from Nicolas Cage and he proves true to form with the intriguing and strange... I still had fun with the film; it just crashed into a brick wall right when it seemed like it was hitting its stride and preparing to deliver the punch-line. DREAM SCENARIO features a compelling concept that at times is really intriguing, but sadly it's often at odds with the film's commentary on pop culture fads. It's a cunning take on media, both social and traditional, as well as pop culture. Director Kristoffer Borgli avoids tarting up his film with flashy CGI, schtick or an overly imposing score. He stands back and lets Cage do his brilliant best. ‚Ä¶ an engaging enough experience while it‚Äôs happening, but one that you‚Äôll likely have trouble recalling when you wake up the next morning. Cage‚Äôs is a tremendous performance that anchors a very good film, a bitter pill chased with a tart cider. ‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt an entirely satisfying film, struggling to balance media satire with an intense personal journey  but Cage‚Äôs memorably agonising performance makes it worth hearing out for anyone concerned about the shallow direction of today‚Äôs online discourse‚Ä¶ While some of these threads are incompletely developed and others dropped entirely, Dream Scenario never collapses in formless entropy thanks in large part to Cage's open-hearted embrace of his character. ...doesn‚Äôt quite know where to go with its high concept. Thematically, Dream Scenario perhaps poses more questions than it is able to effectively answer. Nicolas Cage delivers a wonderful performance in ‚ÄúDream Scenario,‚Äù a quirky dark comedy with fantasy and horror elements. This is only writer/director Borgli‚Äôs second feature after numerous shorts; he‚Äôs clearly a talent to watch for. Part social commentary on instant fame and fast celebrities, Dream Scenario is a wild ride of The Floor is Lava, where the floor is everyday life and the lava is an incessant 24-hour news cycle supplemented by quick-hit socials like Reels and TikTok. An edgy satire about modern celebrity that, as happens so often nowadays, stumbles toward the close but offers so much that‚Äôs good along the way that you forgive its third-act lapses. The good certainly includes Cage‚Äôs witty performance.   Dream Scenario takes a cautionary look at celebrity and cancel culture as it traces the fantastical plight of a nondescript, bespectacled, bald and bearded biology professor named Paul, hilariously brought to life by Nicolas Cage. Dream Scenario is worth watching for its clever premise alone, and the casting of Cage is inspired. The first act is the strongest, and as the narrative shifts to the third act, it loses sight of its thesis. The structure may challenge some viewers, but those who stay engaged will find plenty of awkwardness offering a distinct cinematic pleasure. It has more to say than anticipated, and while the message doesn‚Äôt feel fully explored, there is an originality to this concept that remains intriguing throughout. The way it seamlessly shifts between genres is impressive.","quirky story hilarious at times! Good Cage performance. Leaves the audience with an unsettled feeling, which is a positive. I didn't mind the farting scene, but overall I felt like the story could've used a good deal of tightening up. An ordinary man shows up in the dreams of millions doing seemingly nothing making him a celebrity of sorts. Then suddenly the same man turns violent in the dreams of millions of people & becomes rejected by society for something he never did. Being a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman and Ari Aster, I absolutely loved this. Can't stop thinking about it. And one of Cage's best acting performances. this was a strange, strange movie lmao. nic cage was easily one of my favorite parts of this movie - he was great as this awkward, ""everyday"" professor-turned-celebrity, and all of the little quirks he gave this character had me laughing constantly. most of the jokes in this movie hit for me, and i loved all of the dream sequences as well. they had a really entertaining comedy-horror blend to them.

however, i found the first half to be stronger than the second - by the time the second half came around, i felt like the plot started to wander a little bit and i wasn't really satisfied with where we ended up by the time the credits rolled. there's a lot of great commentary on fame, cancel culture, and capitalist profiteering as well, but i think those ideas would've landed better with a stronger ending, and i think paul's journey as a character would be more meaningful too.

that being said, i still had a smile on my face for a whole lot of this movie, and the first half was fantastic. with a great lead and lots of humor and creativity, i'd say to at least give it a shot, even if you don't enjoy it as much as i do. I think this is a critics movie. One that makes you think just enough to seem profound, but really just tries to hard in the end. Speaking of the end I think this movie would have received maybe one more star if the ending was not so terrible. Overall, it is the odd movie that I am glad I saw but would probably not recommend to others. Nicolas Cage and A24 was not the Dream I thought it would be I suppose using Nicolas Cage‚Äôs name will draw/lure an audience? Nicolas Cage really shines in this movie where he can easily share all the torments, flaws and awkwardness of his character while going more crazy in the dream sequence. The premise is so creative and offers great opportunity to play with drama, humor, surrealism and horror. 

Despite all of this, the movie fell flat here and there. It's mostly due to long scenes that while very funny at first stretches the joke to a boring point. The story doesn't take full advantage of its surrealist premise most of the dream lack imaginative visuals that you would expect from it. 

It's important to know that this movie is mostly an allegory about cancel culture but in the case when the victim who loose everything is not guilty of what he is accusing of. It shows how difficult you can apologize for something that you didn't do but still ruin your reputation and your life. It is an interesting and tricky point of view but this focus slows down the movie that should a use more of visual creativity and let us suffering with a character that just being unfairly hated without any chance to recover. It's a good take on not only the real life lore behind a man who was frequently popping up in dreams, but also how some of us feel so unseen and unheard in life and how that desire can go awry. 


The main character is pretty passive and bland, so when he finds out he's the exact way in dreams, it's deeply upsetting to him. He longs to be exciting, memorable, an active member of these dreams... then he meets the one exception to this, which is where the film takes a darker turn. There are many different meanings to this film (as with all art) and I find myself engaging with all of my thoughts of it. 
Recommended watch. Made me think. Made me feel for all the characters.  Great movie to talk about afterwards. Not the Nick Cage I grew up with, so glad he made this movie. Very A24. Not super dark. If you‚Äôre a Nick Cage fan and an A24 fan I‚Äôll really like this one. Still  deeply thinking about it Interesting idea‚Ä¶. Nicholas Cage was perfect for this role. It was just ok. Love Movies that Feature Music by The Talking Heads. Dream Scenario is a good social commentary on fame and the damages that come with that. But it is difficult to care about the film's main character‚Äî making it difficult to care about the film as a whole. A funny, beautiful, and eloquently delivered satire. Loved every minute of it Provocative and seductive!  Well crafted to keep you involved and guessing! movie with a message....stop worshipping celebrities! Highly original, unpredictable, excellent flow, leading to a topical finale, humanity chooses to live in a dream enabled by technology, though some would really like it to be real. As easy as in a dream celebrities are made then destroyed, hero to villain transformation according to public perception. It's a movie with many layers. Cage is absolutely brilliant.  Another Oscar can be expected for him for this role."
Horror,five_nights_at_freddys,"The adaptation of the 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video game saga is a failed attempt to bring the mock horror of the original to film [Full Review in Spanish]
 Tammi does a great job bringing the 'Five Nights at Freddy's' video game to the big screen. Five Nights At Freddy‚Äôs could have done more to capture the simple terror of its video game inspiration‚Äôs storytelling. However, director Emma Tammi has delivered a crowd-pleasing retro horror that has the potential to be just as much of a cult favourite. Fight Nights at Freddy‚Äôs is just not effective enough as horror and has a slowly plodding pace that can‚Äôt be saved by its talent. The ending sort of sets up a sequel but if we are to spend any more nights at Freddy‚Äôs lets hope the creative team bring more fear and dread to make these animatronic antagonists less cuddly. A tame yet enjoyable triumph for fans of the video game. Those unfamiliar with the series might walk away feeling more lost than a devoted fan. You‚Äôd be forgiven for expecting a zany, over-the-top romp in which heroes battle the increasingly creepy cartoon animal-like robots as they fight to stay alive, but it isn‚Äôt that. Well, OK, it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ kinda that ‚Ä¶ eventually. All this movie needs is Nic Cage and it'd be fine.  A deeply unpleasant and quite ridiculous game of hopscotch among devastating kidnapping thriller, nasty family drama, and empty serial killer nonsense. The film mostly concentrates on Mike‚Äôs familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.  Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it‚Äôs not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it‚Äôs not funny. It‚Äôs barely anything at all. A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you‚Äôve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson. An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it‚Äôs all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza. A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun. So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found. Convoluted subplots risk derailing the narrative on more than one occasion, but Freddy and his menacing cohorts, created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, do just about enough to deliver some fun and frights. Seriously, how do you mess up a setup as foolproof as this one? One of the most forgettable, half-a---d horror movies of the past few years. Five Nights at Freddy's isn't just an ambitious failure; it's a film that treads the water of familiar cliches for an hour and a half and then fizzles out. The film struggles to balance its disparate tones and subject matter (fun animatronics with child murder) while barely containing enough scares and violence to act as a gateway horror flick for pre-teens. At least Matthew Lillard is having fun. The problem could hinge on the film‚Äôs rating. An R might have opened the door to more malevolence. A PG-13 simply makes the lights flicker.","This movie was absolutely amazing! I loved it so much and it shocks me that there are people out there who don't like it. I love so many different movies. They are all near and dear to my heart, but this one. This one will be hard to beat. This is now my most favorite movie of all time, and that's saying a lot. The story was laid out incredibly well, the actors did an amazing job with their roles, and the scenery was perfect. The animatronics were so life-like and I'm so grateful they didn't use CGI. This is huge for people like me in the gaming world! Having a MOVIE made off of a video game you love is big. I also love how Josh Hutcherson was in the movie and played the lead role. He is one of my favorite actors, so it was so much fun having him in this movie. They put so much effort into making this film and I pray that they continue to make FNAF films with the same actors! I hope they do it soon too! Even though the movie just came out! I don't know how I'm going to wait. I am so happy they made this movie, and made it the way they did. SOLID 10/10 and out of 100 I'd probably give it a 98/100. PLEASE MAKE MORE!!! I have a movie poster, and the DVD. I literally bought it the same day it came out. I've seen it so many times! It's so good! I would have died to go to the set and see the real animatronics and the filming location! I have all of my favorite movies on DVD too! I love This will forever be one of my top favorites! This is great, for the game fans. Predictable. The moment I saw Mathew Lillard, I knew he had something to do with the ending. Story of a man desperate for a job so he can keep custody of his sister, so desperate he will work at a place everyone says is haunted.
It's worth a watch, not one I would say was great,but it had a much better plot & twists to it than I expected. One of the best movies I have seen all year The film follows the script of the videogame and there are many scenes that pick frames from it. At the end I found it funny, lightful and good for the storyline but for the filmmaking I expected something more. I want to give Bonnie a hug even if he kills me it's okay As a long time FNAF fan, I really loved this movie. It's not perfect, and there are some flaws but overall I love Josh hutcherson's and Matthew lillard's portrayals of their characters. The movie creates nice suspense and the characters are well made. The only main complaints I have, I think there should've been more gore, and the ending should've been longer, or the movie in general. I would love to see a second FNAF movie.:) O filme √© sensacional para aqueles que s√£o f√£s da franquia de ""Five Nights At Freddy's"", cheio de easter eggs. Por√©m, para o p√∫blico de fora, o filme pode ser bem estranho, e at√© mesmo ruim. E mesmo f√£s da franquia, ainda comentam que se decepcionaram com algumas cenas do filme, e a falta de terror que ele tr√°s e que prometeu. It passed the time, for the one time. As a fan I thought this movie was very well thought out it had so many references to multiple different games in the f.n.a.f universe. I felt like a kid again watching this and reliving my childhood. Me gust√≥ pero no me encant√≥, tiene mucho fan service, lo cual es bueno, pero no asusta, sus efectos y el hecho de estar lejos de la historia que todos conocemos, hace que no sea la mejor. This movie is great, the bite of 87 was scary, 
I love this movie it great and good, I wish fnaf 2 had a R Rated. This movie was THE BEST MOVIE OF MY WHOLE LIFE, it was totally worth the 8 year wait and when the movie finally comes out people say it's boring, not scary, or show the same same scenes, and to all the people who said these things about the movie have POOR taste in good movies, I waited 8 years for this movie and I'm not goons let some dumb critics that prefer cuties then this masterpiece stop me from giving this movie a 1,000,000,000/10 üò†üò†üò§üò§ To get something straight: This movie was made for the fans, NOT for people who are new to the series. 

If you have been a fan for any amount of time, you will adore this film. But whether or not you enjoyed the games, there is one thing that everyone can agree on: They absolutely nailed atmosphere. 

At any extent, you will at least have some fun watching this movie. It was great fun to watch with many little awesome moments for folks who are familiar with the lore. The gore and violence is more implied than shown due to the rating of the film, but it didnt take away from the experience, although more visible gore would've made it more enjoyable as a horror. the plot holes and unanswered questions are to be expected from fnaf but i felt the story was well put together and didn't come off as confusing. the practical effects and animatronics were the highlight of the film, they look amazing and their movement was spot on. the critics have their heads jammed under sand for this one, its a fun time. (definitely worth it to watch a video on the lore if you're interested though.) Yawn ü•±. First half was boring AF. Seems like they could have made this about 30 minutes shorter and it would have been better. Horror movies shouldn't be pg13. I liked Willy's Wonderland better even though it was also bad. I think it was amazing. They revealed things that weren't even in the game and the animatronics looked amazing and the plot was good to. I have been a fan for years and my mom who thought the games were dumb, loved the movie and said she was wrong. I could write a novel full of what I didn't like about this, but I won't do that here, for everyone's sake. To put it short and to the point: as a fan of the video games, I was severely disappointed. This was easily the worst film I've seen this year, and I watched The Burning Moon just a week before seeing this mess. La verdad, no me gustaba Fnaf cuando era chiquito, pero gracias a la pel√≠cula: Ya soy muy fan de la saga y la recomiendo mucho para los fans como para los no tan fans"
Horror,peeping_tom_1960,"It‚Äôs a horror classic of the highest order, a piece of master filmmaking by an iconic artist at the top of his game. The film remains dangerous and brilliant... A feverish cult object among horror acolytes and classic film buffs alike.  [Michael Powell] did not write Peeping Tom; but he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for this essentially vicious film.  A masterclass in filmmaking that puts a sociopath in a sympathetic light. Uncomfortable but compelling, Peeping Tom is not to be missed.  This proto-slasher film is making fascinating observations about class, nationality and gender, but it's so well integrated it never feels heavy handed. Powell's meta shooting style is inspired and Vivian Shearer makes a big impression in only 2 scenes. Mark who is the peeping tom in this situation is probably up there with one of the most complex characters in cinema. Directed by Michael Powell with British Anarchy ... crazy but exquisitely reserved. Recognized now as one of his greatest films, a primer for the use of the camera as an eye and point of view. We are all voyeurs when we watch a movie Almost all who act as voyeurs in their love of cinema will never hurt another person- not fatally, anyway. That doesn't mean we aren't irreparably altered by our voyeurism. A timeless and sublime masterpiece that presents an incredibly intelligent and moving picture of psychological struggle. An integral film for the development of the horror genre. Peeping Tom didn't make me want to streak out of the cinema shrieking, as Franju's film did at times; it gives me the creeps in retrospect, in my heart and mind more than in my eyes. Carl Boehm must be credited with a portrayal whose discretion has probably saved the film from its own worst excesses of morbidity. So many movies about the most depraved of life-takers also function as therapies for their audiences; this one makes us accessories to deplorable deeds, and rejects all opportunities to find relief from them. It is now justly recognized as a classic of its disturbing kind, treating its material with a restraint, seriousness, and compassion that many of today's filmmakers could learn from. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is the best movie ever made about the voyeuristic allure of making and watching movies. Fear, as it turns out, is the most frightening thing in the world, and Peeping Tom makes us feel it palpably as few films have been able to do. Although seemingly about a creep who kills, it is as much about our own voyeuristic fascination with movies. Almost forty years later, Powell's audaciousness, satirical wit and dazzling color sense still crackle with life. Peeping Tom reminds us of the scary, primitive power of movies by putting us, as viewers, in the position of its peeping protagonist. As the psychopath sets up his victims for the kill, we see them through his eyes.","Irredeemably awful and, for what is supposed to be a legendary cinematic groundbreaker, is more boring than sitting in the dentist's waiting room and as entertaining as cleaning the cat litter box.

Powell: yes, the legend who brought us ""The Thief of Baghdad"" and ""The Red Shoes"" (which, as a former ballet dancer and later a balletmaster, remains a personal favourite).  But ‚Ä¶ a decade or two later and the trademarks have not matured: retina-burning oversaturated colours, over-staged blocking (he's what'cha call an auteur, ain't he?), and mindboggling, dreadful acting down the line (OK ‚Äì I liked the brief dance/murder sequence with Moira Shearer, but the choreography looked like something Mary Tyler Moore did on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" in the same era).

Karlheinz B√∂hm (whose main attribute is that he is a son of Karl B√∂hm, one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century and a Nazi collaborator; he did his post-war time and went on to conduct until he could barely lift the baton) seems to be aping Peter Lorre and has all the charisma of a public lavatory floor.

And he is just one among a sea of zombies.

I am extremely disappointed: I was led on for decades about what a masterpiece it was, and now that I finally catch up with it (thank you, Criterion; can I please get my money back?), I am hugely disappointed on every possible level.

To suggest this was ""groundbreaking"" and ""ahead of its time"" is pure heresy.  Kindly have a look at what a true auteur was doing around 1960: watch some Goddard (up to 1967) and Truffaut and anybody from the nouvelle vague, some Visconti and Bertolucci, some Fellini, some Kurosawa and Teshigahara, some Bu√±uel, some Kubrick, some ‚Ä¶ OK.  You get the idea. There's much to admire, technically at least, if not in other aspects too, in Michael Powell's film, which many consider as the first slasher film. The location shots are like visual records of 1960s London while Powell's fluid camerawork is dramatic, informative and creative. Leo Marks' chilling screenplay about Carl Boehm's Mark Lewis, a shy, camera-obsessed young man who murders prostitutes and actresses in order to capture on film their last moments of fear, is also ahead of its time if only in its inclusion of the killer's backstory to make him more human and sympathetic. However, at the same time ironically, it's hard not to find this all a bit dated as well, especially with the modern audience's considerably desensitized palate, both regarding nudity and violence to women. Boehm's acting is on the uneven side, sometimes very convincing but too arch and laboured at other times (though that unintentionally funny and amateurish final scene is entirely Powell's fault); while the jury is still out, at least for me, whether Moira Shearer's dance of death is an ingenious bit of suspense building or just there to remind us she was in The Red Shoes before. However, the casting of real-life nude model/entrepreneur Pamela Green as one of Mark's models and Powell and his son playing Mark's abusive father and young Mark respectively are fascinating decisions that film academics and psychoanalysts will have a field day with. While I'm glad I've seen this, and it is an accomplished film in its own right, I can also understand why, as Hitchcockian as this film is, why the similarly themed Psycho, also released in the same year, did better business and is better remembered in comparison to this steely and creepy arthouse counterpart. Last of the BFI top 100 British films I had to see. I watched it in style in the Prince Charles cinema. Pretty oddball serial killer film. Not really scary, odd moments of lightheartedness. Does a job to entertain but not much more. It came out the same year as Psycho, got overshadowed by Psycho, and I like it a bit more than Psycho. That being said I don't love Psycho as much as most people. 

I was bored for a while and thought parts were kinda silly and feel very dated. By the end though I had grown quite attached to our main couple, even the murdery one. The characters in this movie are so 3 dimensional and sympathetic. Perhaps all filmmaking is a kind of voyeurism. Sometimes a movie is made at the wrong time and in the wrong place. In the case of Peeping Tom, the movie was made at the right time but in the wrong place.

In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock directed Psycho, a movie about a voyeuristic serial killer who targeted sexually attractive women due to his inability to let go of deep-seated psychological problems that he had with a parent. The result was an enormously successful movie that greatly enhanced Hitchcock's reputation and helped to open the door for a new decade of cinema where sex and violence became more explicit.

Meanwhile in the same year, Michael Powell made Peeping Tom in Britain, a movie that dealt with the same subjects. But what a difference in response! Guests at the premiere to Peeping Tom shunned Powell. The film received such harsh reviews that it was pulled from the cinema in less than a week. Powell's career in England was ruined, and he was never allowed to make another movie in Britain again. He made a few films in Australia, but none of them acquired the same fame or respect as his earlier ones.

Nowadays Peeping Tom is regarded as one of Powell's greatest films, and an early example of a slasher movie. This last description is misleading, as Powell's film had little influence on later cinema due to its limited availability for many years.

We may well wonder what all the fuss is about. The sex and violence depicted in Peeping Tom seems mild now. In spite of victims being speared in the throat by a blade, we see no blood at all. There is some full frontal nudity for the first time in a mainstream British movie, but very little of that.

So what made Peeping Tom so offensive? One factor is where Powell made the movie. British culture had that curious mixture of sexual inhibition and perversity that Powell portrays in the film, and this repressed attitude meant that Powell's comparatively graphic portrayal of sex and violence was anathema to many. By contrast, there was a comparatively relaxed attitude in America where Hitchcock was working.

The opening scene of this movie sets the tone for what is to come. In a film about scoptophilia (or scopophilia, i.e. voyeurism), the first image that we see is an eye. We are watching someone as he watches a woman. The observer is our ‚Äòhero', Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm). He is wearing a long overcoat that makes you think of a flasher, and in a way that is what he is.

However his overcoat is not designed to reveal, but to conceal. The flashing that he has in mind is the kind that he makes from the camera that he carries with him everywhere, his ‚Äòthird arm' as one character calls it. The only exposure that he is interested in is the kind that decides the light and dark of a camera, and he is not interested in revealing himself physically, but in revealing the darker side of others.

The audience are not to be let off the hook in Powell's film. Our voyeuristic love of violence and sex on film is similar to that of Mark, but not taken to the extreme that Mark takes it. Most of us do not take a prurient pleasure in sexual murders, but many of us enjoy watching them when they are on our screens or in the newspaper.

Peeping Tom was one of the first movies to present events from the point of view of the killer. This makes him seem uncomfortably sympathetic and tragic, and the audience are called on to feel a reluctant identification with him. 

The man who provides the voice of Mark's father is Michael Powell himself. The scenes are shot in Powell's own home, and the boy who plays the young Mark is Powell's son. When Helen finally watches one of Mark's murders on film, Powell places the camera in the same position that Mark wished to place it when he asked to film her reactions to his earlier film.

This identifies a problem not just with Mark and his father, but with Powell himself. What is movie if not a violation of its subject matter? Indeed one of Mark's victims is an actress, Vivian (Moira Shearer) who genuinely imagines that she is shooting a private film with him up until the moment that he kills her.

Finally in the movie's last image, the reel stops spinning, and the screen fades to red, as we hear the voice of his father on tape: ""Don't be a silly boy. There's nothing to be afraid of."" If only that were true.

I wrote a longer appreciation of Peeping Tom on my blog page if you would like to read more: https://themoviescreenscene.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/peeping-tom-1960/ ""Peeping Tom"" (1960) is one of the most influential horror films of all time. Director Michael Powell and co-writer Leo Marks have crafted a complex and suspenseful story with a sympathetic yet monstrously wounded protagonist. Mark Lewis is a unique character, as his struggles with his own inner demons are explored in detail. Helen Stephens, the love interest of Mark, adds an extra layer of complexity to the story, as we watch Mark grapple with his feelings for her. The kills in this film are not any less chilling, but they affect us on a deeper level due to Powell's masterful direction. I had no expectations when I began watching ""Peeping Tom"" (1960), yet I was blown away by the end. If you are a horror fan, this one is a must-see. Great filmmaking. Like Hitchcock films, this is a crucial work in this type of thriller, and this has great color and British wit/darkness. Definitely still watchable. Tension retains throughout from the beginning to the end. More potent today than ever, as everyone films everything as a fetish. Downright tasteful compared to the sick bloodbath it would be now. My only quibble is how after Helen‚Äôs first visit to his apartment, she doesn‚Äôt get the creeps and why would she go back? Even striking up romantic feelings for him? Ok 1960 - that sets the mood for what you do and do not get to see.  It is appropriately creepy and moves right along exposing the mind of a man that is just not quite all there after being subjected to a not so loving Father and his cruel ways of bringing up a son as a guinea pig. Love the visual nature of the film. The vivid colors are great.  I would say - ""Check this one out."" I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this film. It definitely works to scare on multiple levels but I just question its underlying function. Peeping Tom is a prototype for many tropes that would be common in many slashers/serial killer films to follow. The story is somewhat like a car crash in that you almost want to look away but can't. But isn't that somewhat what the content of this film is about? A bit like seeing heavy displays of affection in public, no one wants to stare/watch it but it makes everyone double take. I feel like perversion was almost too prevalent of a theme but I feel in some ways the director was trying to make some sort of Freudian statement on nudity and its effects on people, a statement that was lost on me but probably helped add to the uncanny atmosphere that lingers through the film. If you are a fan of horror/classic horrors this film is an essential viewing. I found this a surprisingly tense and somewhat sinister film. Its not a gory film but the viewer can guess whats going to happen in advance and yet we're kept in the dark in terms of what will be the final act to prompt the violent action (which is mostly hinted at/shown off camera). Its a reasonably early attempt at British horror or claustrophobic thriller I suppose and the fact that the main character, Mark Lewis, is fairly attractive to look at and seemingly a quiet and perhaps somewhat reserved person, is interesting in terms of them not being an obviously dangerous person to look at, although he does appear somewhat menacing when seen staring, as an observer from somewhat distant spaces but I won't say anymore so as not to provide spoilers, other than it does definitely have a claustrophobic feel to it, almost, perhaps, like the films of Hitchcock. 

I suppose the plot is fairly slow, certainly for a modern day horror film - its not quite a regular horror film but it is somewhat unsettling and, as I say, tense. As a slow burning psychological thriller type film, I thought it was reasonably thoughtful and it does well at keeping the viewer guessing and perhaps on the edge of your seat. I imagine when it was released in 1960, it was quite frightening/scary, potentially, to viewers at that time. I'd recommend this film, yes. The greatest Alfred Hitchcock film that Alfred Hitchcock wasn't involved with. Well that was certainly before it's time. Demented , disturbing and complex. Think Hitchcock with a sensible story. Beautiful Powell color. Fascinating to see this early movie influence finsllt, An Obvious impact on Manhunter, a favorite of mine. Even as far reaching as the lousy Sliver and almost good Strange Days. 1960 and it still works. Scoptophelia.  - a new word for me! Small wonder the Brits shunned it back then. Bleak. This is a true classic, powerful piece of film-making with incredible acting by Bohm and expert directing from Powerll, which product sadly cut his career short. The color solutions in this film are just astounding, it's so saturated and at the same time so menacing; the psychological constituent of this movie, developed in the main character, is quite chilling and horrifying and which would serve to be a blueprint for future great and not so great thriller and horror movies. Everyone is a peeping tom in this timeless masterpiece. The movie was disturbing in 1960 and it still is today. The advent of the internet and social media make it even more relevant and thought-provoking. Nearly five decades later, Peeping Tom is still hailed as one of the most crucial films in establishing the horror genre. It's unique, subversive, and truly ahead of its time. Interesting concept, but pretty tame by current standards.  Some compare this to Psycho but there is NO comparison. Michael Powell made The Red Shoes, which is about dedication to ballet, and also made this, which is one of the first movies to have a slasher POV shot and it nearly ruined his career and I can appreciate that duality.

Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is never seen without his camera, which allows him to capture life, but is really an instrument of death, recording the last minutes of the lives of several ladies of the evening. It doesn't seem that Mark gets any delight out of these kills, only watching them, planning them, covering up his involvement and doing it again. He's spent most of his life being a constantly recorded live test subject for his recently deceased father, teaching dear old dad the psychological impact of fear on the nervous system.

When he meets Helen, who is writing a children's book about a magic camera, he spies on her from afar but she rewards his shyness and oddities with kindness. It's an alien tongue to Mark, who is used to dealing with women who exchange cash for intimacy and are repaid with death.

Predating Psycho by two months, slasher films find some of their start here. Yet this film goes beyond the codified must-haves of the form to present a killer that we start to empathize with, as strange as that sounds. Mark has never had a chance, never had anyone who cared about him more than as a test subject. He was even recorded as he struggled at his mother's death bed.

When released in puritanical Britain, this movie was savaged and Powell's career neer recovered. There's a theory that this reaction is why Hitchcock never screened Psycho for critics and wet directly to the common people with it. He was worried that a film with similar beats would be seen in the same light. It would be years until the film was praised as much as it deserved.

Scorcese went so far to recommend this movie that he claimed that a filmmaker could study only Fellini's 8¬Ω and this and learn all there was to know about fimmaking; they ""‚Ä¶say everything that can be said about film-making, about the process of dealing with film, the objectivity and subjectivity of it and the confusion between the two. 8¬Ω captures the glamour and enjoyment of film-making, while Peeping Tom shows the aggression of it, how the camera violates. From studying them you can discover everything about people who make films, or at least people who express themselves through films."" An unsettling examination of the nature of voyeurism, fear and the cinematic medium. Peeping Tom was released a few months before Hitchcock's Psycho, which makes it arguably the first slasher film. It was also the first film to show a murder from the killer's point of view, thereby making the audience complicit in the crime. Critics at the time called the film ""filthy and sordid"", but with hindsight it is considered a classic of British cinema."
Horror,a_creature_was_stirring,"The film has a great cast, direction, set pieces, creature design, and holiday lighting, but first time screenwriter Shannon Wells' ending torpedoes the whole thing. It's worth checking out, but oof. While smartly relying more on its performance and chemistry than creature carnage or gore (although what‚Äôs here is suitably grisly), A Creature Was Stirring can‚Äôt overcome the limitations that constantly undercut the promise of its title.
 The trajectory of the narrative may be predictable, but the storyline is enjoyably dark. Unfortunately, though, the conclusion is mangled by ridiculously cheap and lazy editing, breaking any discomfort that had been created. A Creature Was Stirring provides enough good things to be worth watching overall. Feel free to laugh at the sheer height of the concept, but be glad that neither the actors nor the director do so. Psychological chills, creature thrills, and family dysfunction become this unfocused commentary on the looming specter of addiction. The unclear nature of the rules and mythology of the horror of A Creature Was Stirring becomes increasingly frustrating as the movie progresses. A Creature Was Stirring is not revenge of a beast story or an attack of a spirit but a human frailty of a secret that literally consumes a mind, a suitcase, and life. ‚ÄúA Creature Was Stirring‚Äù has an interesting take on human frailty, but it‚Äôs really the stuff of short films, with LaVeck visibly struggling to stretch the story to a longer run time. A Creature Was Stirring does not ignore the more visceral scares. There are some impressive special effects that range from scary to just plain disgusting. The monster is based on something that is terrifying in its own right but rarely seen in horror.","This holiday horror film tries to do too much and devolves into a chaotic nightmare. Had hopes it was going to be a Christmas horror movie, the only thing Christmas about it was the colors with thrown in candy canes. The movie was so bad and made zero sense. The big finale would've made it somewhat worth it had there been implications throughout the movie instead of being super rushed the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. Just watch something else! Would of been better as a short story, this one is very passable. A film that falls flat on its face. Thumbs down"
