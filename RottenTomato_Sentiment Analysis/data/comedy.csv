Comedy,wonka,"Writer/director Paul King sugar-coats every candy-colored scene in this sweetly sumptuous fantasy, starring appealing Timothy Chalamet as inscrutable Willy Wonka. It‚Äôs understandable for folks to be a bit suspicious of this prequel. Fortunately, ‚ÄúWonka‚Äù manages to deliver in just about every way imaginable. This movie is overflowing with marvellous, fantastical imagery... Chalamet brings an infectious and unparalleled level of joy to the character.  Talented young Timothee Chalamet nicely carries the title role of his sweet candymaker into legitimate prequel territory with a musical treat filled with morsels that might be simply devoured by the entire family. I can‚Äôt be upset at a movie with this much warmth and craft across the board, one that believes so earnestly... It‚Äôs not a bad movie, though. It‚Äôs just kind of odd, like watching Hugh Grant play an Oompa Loompa: Uncomfortable, bizarre and, yes, kind of offensive. Timoth√©e Chalamet underwhelms in a scattershot origin story that mixes too many ingredients into its chocolate-covered plot. Everywhere you look in Wonka is a surprise, and every emotional beat lands, drawing us more and more into this vibrant and delicious world. Wonka, like its namesake‚Äôs ‚Äúunbeatable eatables‚Äù, is a sweet treat for all ages.  Sometimes, all a film needs to be is a load of fun, and Wonka certainly is with a stunning production design, a compelling group of actors, and a heartwarming story at its center. I don't know if you'll be humming any of the songs on the way out of the theater, but this unashamedly corny Wonka surpassed my hopes. I ask for no more. Like its titular protagonist, Wonka has just enough magic to pull from some unseen corner of its hat to have fans walk away feeling like the treat was worth it.  Timothee Chalamet works overtime to enchant without capturing iconic role. In a word, Wonka is scrumdidilyumptious.  This film is supposed to be a fun diversion with simple emotional appeal, catchy songs, and some dark undertones, and that‚Äôs precisely what it is. You can hear Roald Dahl rolling in his grave, but gently, gently. Wonka is pure imagination, full of joy and whimsy. Timoth√©e Chalamet floats on air in his most charismatic performance yet in this rousing musical stacked with captivating songs and a cast who came to play. There are issues with Wonka, make no mistake, but in King‚Äôs hands, it‚Äôs not the empty corporate endeavor it could have been. The movie aims to please and mostly succeeds, even if it‚Äôs so goofily earnest you occasionally want to punch it in the face. With its delightful combination of magic, humor, and heart, Wonka is a cinematic confection that will leave audiences with a sweet taste and a renewed belief in the magic of dreams. Well this was a pleasant surprise! A family flick with a wonderful performance by Timoth√©e Chalamet, who has enough charm to sustain the 2-hour runtime. ","So cute! Absolutely loved it! I loved the movie. It was very magical. Timothy was great as Wonka. Pure imagination. Wonka was a delight.  It's a complete story on its own that gives subtle props to the original without leaning on it.  Original, whimsical and fun and It was a nice surprise to learn the origins of some iconic quotes.  Timothee Chalamet shined as the young version of our beloved Willy Wonka and Hugh Grant was wonderful as the saucy Oompa Loompa.  It was a fun ride, with an emotional ending that made me feel all warm inside.  To paraphrase, ""So Shines a Great Film in a Weary World"" :) Its a good movie just too much singing base on the start of the wonka factory . Enjoyed this new wonka story Wonka was a cute story line from the original Willie Wonkas Chocolate Factory. Main character was excellent. Great family movie. Very very sweet. Not as good as the original, but was really good. The songs were catchy and it was a thriller. It was a great start to the story of Wonka. Enjoyed all the songs and the story. Vey sweet.  Liked it alot This was the prequel I never knew I needed! Was such a good movie.. I think I smiled from the beginning to the end ( except when the tears kinda came but I think someone was cutting onions behind me ü§£). You must like musicals,to like this movie.because there is lots of singing,but I liked the story line.i love musicals. This movie is probably the worst 2 hours of my life. They ruined a classic with garbage. This movie was absolutely amazing! I loved everything there was to it! There was the emotion, the story, and Wonka himself! This movie was perfect! 12/10 from me! Worst Willy Wonka movie ever. Story plot was way off. It was like they got a bunch of people who had never seen or heard of Willy Wonka to make it. Sorry I wasted a Saturday afternoon and the money to see it. Musical numbers were too much. Really took away from story and experience. Enough similarities to the original to feel nostalgic, but with a new and different vibe. Lots of music! Really nice prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Really great movie. Great story, great acting, funny, interesting, emotional. It's all there. Best movie I've seen in a while. Really good. Surprised how good it was. Well that was a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Our family has such a strong attachment to the original and my now 17-year-old daughter was obsessed with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when she was little. Filling the role of Wonka is a tall order and Timothee Chalamet did not disappoint.  My daughter gave it a 7 out of 10 and I have to give it a solid 8 out of 10. There were several laugh out loud moments and the cast was perfect."
Comedy,trolls_band_together,"Fans will love the music, but the story falls short, and the character-growth is lackluster. ‚Ä¶unlike Barbie, there‚Äôs no take on the material at all here, it‚Äôs just an advert for a brand of dolls, a ‚Äòjoy bomb‚Äô that resolutely fails to explode‚Ä¶ A passable, middling candy-coloured time killer, though it moves so fast it doesn‚Äôt allow much time to get involved with the characters or engage with the story. It‚Äôs like an iridescent blur set to pop songs. This is the third installment of the Trolls franchise, so it's not surprising that it has all the individuality and inspiration of a Big Mac.  Trolls Band Together has enough of the right stuff to keep the target audience and their kids entertained. It‚Äôs a veritable feast of boy band-related gags, many of which are hilarious. This movie is a disjointed piece of non-stop stimuli. It‚Äôs an attack on the senses where the set pieces blend into each other. It genuinely feels like an acid trip at times. DreamWorks Animation will keep churning them out, but Trolls Band Together would be a perfect place to end this mildly successful fun run of splashy color, slick music, and wacky energy. I will give Trolls Band Together this much: it is the first film in the series that did not give me a headache. At a mile-a-minute, Trolls Band Together rarely allows a moment to catch your breath, but when it‚Äôs having so much fun, I don‚Äôt really think anyone will complain. The whole movie feels a bit like a laboratory for playing with new examples of the series' defined aesthetic. it‚Äôs all fun, with enjoyable tunes new and old, and some very impressive animation as well.  The sibling focus means that younger viewers will get to see Branch humorously (and movingly) interact with his big brothers (who still see him as a baby), which adds depth to his behavior in the first movie.  With even more glitter, this high-energy sequel is an almost mind-boggling flurry of colour, music, comedy and action mayhem. Apart from the intricacy of some of the animation, there‚Äôs nothing exceptional about Trolls Band Together. But it is exactly what it is designed to be ‚Äì amiable, tuneful, brisk and upbeat. Its ambitions are modest, but it fulfills them entirely. Trolls Band Together nails the perfect harmony between musical numbers, character development and an exceptionally timed 90-minute adventure with plenty of spunk and nostalgia to appease all. Good ol' JT returns for his third vocal take on the ever-wary, if heroic troll named Branch, this time going way, way back to when he was still in diapers and -- who knew? -- performing in the five-member group, ""BroZone."" Trolls Band Together becomes the most eccentric of its predecessors, taking visual and kinesthetic overstimulation to the next level to hypnotize the audience (especially the little ones who will receive it like a sugar overdose) [Full Review in Spanish] This gentle poke at boy bands is full of fun. I swear. The boy band craze is real and it only gets deeper, so I gave it an A-.","I loved all the boy band references and omg nsync as trolls was fabulous üëå My daughters and I loved it !!
Read the perfect movie to watch during Christmas break and Even as an adult I enjoyed it. Maybe even more than the kids. Great for Kids and Hilarious for adults that grew up in the New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys, NSync, and 98 degrees! This is the better troll's film out of the three although I still have a slight feeling that there was going to be something cringy there was never really any cringe moments in this film, good job universal. I remember liking the 2016 Trolls film, and though the sequel was less surprising it was still fun, but this one's had any remaining soul sucked out of it both visually and aurally. So catchy and cute the trolls franchise is really out here pulling a Toy Story one banger after another Little to much adult content for a kids movie A boy band of singers break up because of a misunderstanding & reunite years later to rescue one of the brothers who is having the talent absorbed out of him & slowly killing him. 
Songs of the 1980's & 1990's are all in the movie, cute feel good family movie. It was a nice sequel with lots of laughs for children and adults um exelente filme bons personagens piadas que funcionam mas muita cantoria e uma resolu√ß√£o muito fraca we loved how silly it was and hilarious and awesome and the casting was awesome I love these films but NGL, I fell asleep. Better than the 2nd movie by far. This had a cohesive story and great music. I thought it was very entertaining! I really loved the movie, velvet and veneer were my favorite and the lore justify together really well. Pues el 60% es algo, pero yo le pondr√≠a el 70% porque es una conmovedora historia que me hace reflexionar de como me llevo con mi hermanito y (Alerta de Spoiler) Con Poppy y Branch de novios, Branch teniendo m√°s parientes y aprovechando tambi√©n Poppy tiene una hermana y lo m√°s lindo: el beso de Poppy y Branch al final hizo que se volviera 100 veces mejor que las anteriores. love it best trolls movie The movie feels blend, without a soul. There are some funny moments but the story doesn't really know where it wants to go. The main characters are more background characters, and the strangest is when the style of the film changes and the trolls and the surrounding feel like being made by a different studio. Predictable plot. First movie was great, this movie is just building on its success. Kids are obsessed and watched it multiple times. The Greatest Movie of All Time!"
Comedy,wish_2023,"It loses meaning, interest, and beauty as it becomes more obvious and repetitive as a visual and plot gift to an expanding universe. [Full Review in Spanish]
 It‚Äôs difficult to get excited about a movie that feels as empty as Wish does. Disney must step back and not rely on our love of existing stories.  It's a solid, solid way to celebrate its anniversary.  Wish‚Äôs release coincides with the 100th anniversary of Walt Disney Studios. Unfortunately, this only highlights what is missing from this by-the-numbers fairytale that never comes close to emulating the magic of the past.  Wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams. It's another charming chapter in Disney's vast library, offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages. The real draw is the animation. It's like WISH took 2D cell paintings and modeled them in 3D. The duality can be jarring at first, but quite beautiful the more you sit with it. While not an instant classic, the music-filled adventure is a wholly enjoyable, perfectly pleasant cinematic experience ‚Äî one with a message about holding on to and working toward one‚Äôs dreams. I enjoyed this movie, even though I felt a bit left out by it. I recommend watching this film with subtitles which include song lyrics (some subtitles include song lyrics, some don't). [The] opening sequence highlights Wish‚Äòs biggest problem: the writing and directing just don‚Äôt match up. The unfortunate result is a movie that never lives up to its potential. On the basis of its half-thought-out script, Hollywood writers‚Äô fears of being supplanted by artificial intelligence appear well-founded. This movie seems proud, even smug, about recycling scraps from other fairy tales. Wish features plenty of classic Disney nods, a great performance from DeBose, and two solid musical numbers. Unfortunately, this story feels rushed, scattered, and extremely familiar. The villainous arc goes nowhere, and the spark is somewhat missing. ‚Ä¶ a centennial production that manages to do what Disney have repeatedly struggled with and properly tap back into that sense of wonder and childlike joy that audiences to this day associate with the studio. Disney once upon a time provided outstanding movie magic for the entire family. Sadly that time has passed. Ironically, in its desire to celebrate Disney magic, Wish fails to generate any magic of its own. For anyone looking to feel the magic of Disney, there are at least 50 better options available on Disney+.  At a breezy 95 minutes, Wish doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome and kids are sure to enjoy the cute critters and slapstick set pieces. Older fans, however, may realize their true wish is to see something else. Do you remember when a Disney animated feature film was an event? I sure do. The animation is ugly, the story is confusing, the characters are an unappealing jumble of badly-expressed traits, the voice acting is meager, the songs are an affront. Despite the passive nature of his foul(ish) scheme, Magnifico is Disney‚Äôs best villain since Tangled. Wish can be described as the cinematic equivalent of the gift shop you‚Äôre forced to walk through at the end of the ride. It‚Äôs not the worst movie that you will bring your kids to but the obvious goal is to vacuum up more money for the mouse.","I feel like the songs were very meh. For the Disney 100 film I definitely thought they would do a lot more. The movie just seems lazy and like they didn't really have much to go with. Good movie with an original story. Good family fun. An obvious cash grab. Mediocre animation made by folks who think traditional is an impossible standard, bad music, obnoxious protagonist and an empty plot with empty characters. Loved itclassic Disney! Wish es lo m√°ximo es s√∫per me hace recordar a los cl√°sicos de Disney y las canciones que ofrece su super y la animaci√≥n est√° genial la recomiendo esta tan genial que me la e visto 4 veces It was okay, pleasant enough for a rainy afternoon but it was pretty lacklustre. And the score was awful, like the composer and writers and musicians worked separately till the last moment and just forced what they had together, not the usual melodic wonders we expect from Disney. Shame it could of been a great movie Beautiful! Loved it when I figured out what direction it was going and being right in the end. Worthy Disney songs! Finally! Sad movie. You would expect better for a 100-year anniversary. It's a very shallow movie, it has every cliche in the book, and there are so many easter eggs they almost forget to put a story. For a movie to celebrate the 100th year anniversary, it is s***. A middle of the road Disney princess movie. The art style is very good, songs are ok. 
But the story itself doesn't know what it is. I felt the main antagonist was kind of in the right to begin with. What transpired with the protagonist was a bit contrived and unfair to the antagonist. It all culminated in a bland ending that seemed to be building towards something more interesting. Cute, not the best of Disney movies but had some great homages celebrating thr 100th. Stay til the end of the credits! Wish was Great. Made my daughters birthday wish come true This movie had so much potential. But at the end of the day it was a weak story, easter egg riddled which made me feel that they where putting up as much smoke as possible to hide the fact they knew the move sucked. Then there was the music. Honestly. Disney hasn't had a good score since the 90s. This one tops the list for the least thought out most clunky wording and the most forgettable. Remember when you use to want to hear a Disney song on the radio, or hummed it the rest of the day after you got out of the theater. No risk of that with this movie. I will say that the visuals where quite good. Which is why I say it has potential. But man did they miss the mark. No wonder critics panned this movie. I think they where honestly just being nice. Movie was super okay.  Two good songs and Chris Pine is great.  Several songs lacked that sin along quality. Story got bogged down a few times.  Story was locked in as homage to prior films and did that, but it was clear ttory was built around that. Will thrill super fans and be so-so for those not searching for Easter eggs. Amazing cute and adorable. Exactly what Disney should do more often. It is lovely. Sweet. Good songs. Entertaining. I want more. So cute! Loved every minute! Extremely bland characters and premise. Asha was a really poorly made knock-off of Mirabel. The goat was cute, and the star was cute. My little brother liked it but it left no lasting impact on him like a lot of other films (he's 9). My mother slept through the whole thing so it was a nice nap for her. I watched it and was incredibly disappointed. It's just‚Ä¶ bland. This was the second time seeing Wish. Love all things Disney so this movie was on my daughters list to watch once it came out in theaters. She was singing along and cant wait for the movie to be out on dvd This was a really good movie. The ending credits give a moving tribute to 100 years of Disney I think I've legitimately seen better AI shorts on YouTube. This hot corporate-written garbage could be weaponized and violate the Geneva Convention. If this is Disney's celebration of 100 years it's time we cremate the corpse of the company, and maybe Bob Iger for good measure"
Comedy,saltburn,"Entertaining but the movie seems to have been patched together from other familiar movies. Films about English class privilege used to be sane, continuing a proud tradition. Now the worst people in Hollywood make films about the worst people in the world. Fennell sells attitude to replace knowledge and feeling. Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' examines envy, classism and a murky romance in the shadow of a gothic-tinged mansion. But for all its ambition, the film falls short in how it tells its seemingly audacious story. [Full Review in Spanish] The sexual groveling of Oliver is akin to the social groveling of anyone who worships the ultra rich simply for being rich. Director Emerald Fennell continues to prove she is one of our most creative storytellers with Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi giving standout performances.  Stupid careless rich people are always entertaining even if there's absolutely nothing new being said, and the numerous scenes here where class and status is undermined and then re-enforced have an engaging energy to them. I admired SALTBURN's boldness, but as a dramatic and thematic exercise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  With excellent acting, arresting visuals and art direction to die for, this is one of the most original movies to be released in years. Possesses an originality re obsession that is deeper than the surface. Barry Keoghan's Oliver uplifts the emotions in his situations, and the supporting cast shines, especially Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike in key story moments. w/Emerald interview. Saltburn embraces that universally cosmic dread of being a revolting human being and builds an extravagant labyrinth of a castle on top of it. Saltburn is disgustingly mesmerizing, and Barry Keoghan gives the perverted performance of a lifetime. Emerald Fennell‚Äôs latest provocation is tasty fare, if a bit unclear about who‚Äôs the main course. Saltburn will get the town talkin‚Äô that is for damn sure. Will this conversation stand the test of time? All signs point to: NO.  Consistently amusing‚Äîthe film namechecks Evelyn Waugh, but the sardonic tone feels closer to Kingsley Amis‚Äîand the actors are a blast to watch interact with each other. The shock value here is quite....forward, but don't let that get in the way of the absolutely fierce performance by Barry Keogan.  Mr. Keoghan has an uncanny ability to come across as shifty and devious even in repose, and his performance is the key to the movie. It is through its unapologetic manipulation that a movie which might easily otherwise have been just another mindless, lurid thriller [turn] into a savage piece of cinema that you‚Äôll want to see again and again. Unlike ""Promising Young Woman,"" it doesn‚Äôt tap into the rage of its day. It‚Äôs just purposelessly unpleasant. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Talented Mr. Ripley‚Äù meets ‚ÄúCall Me By Your Name‚Äù ‚Äî insidious, class conscious, with a bit of violence and a serious taste of the sexually kinky if not downright icky. Fine, disreputable fun until what might be the stupidest, most misguided ending I‚Äôve seen since‚Ä¶ well, since Fennell‚Äôs previous picture. Fennell‚Äôs stunning visuals and Barry Keoghan‚Äôs excellence lift ""Saltburn"" to must-watch status.","I‚Äôm not sure what to think of Saltburn. Yes, wealthy people can be cruel but I think hating them and plotting their demise makes one worse. It‚Äôs worth a watch and not at all what I expected. And, there are a few weird sex scenes to go along with this weird film. Where to begin... it's weirdly good. Absolutely loved the movie.  I felt as an audience member that I was being respected as an adult.  Overall A++++++ Beautifully shot and acted - the first 3/4 are superb but it ends a little lackluster (although love Barry's buns) Saltburn is Brideshead Revisited reimagined. Filled with sharp cutting dialog and wild plot twists it provides a very enjoyable and funny ride.  Excellent performances by all including Barry Keoghan Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Archie Madekwe Slow paced, somewhat predictable, I felt it would never end,  almost walked out of the theater several times! If you occasionally would like to see redeeming or sympathetic traits in a movie's characters, you won't find it here. Push this envelope into the trash. A smart, twisted satire about the dark qualities of humanity. Incredible performances. Just dreadful, it was supposed to be a dark comedy.. The hell was that? This is a fiendishly crafty satire about a poor young scholar, Oliver, up at Oxford who is at first exiled with the nerds. From this vantage point he can only see from a distance the cool kids and the pretty boys and girls. But slowly, and gradually, he wins acceptance and befriends Felix, a popular and aristocratic student who lives in a great big beautiful country house. Oliver gets invited back to the stately home known as ‚ÄòSaltburn' and Felix's eccentric family embraces, in their way, Oliver, and Oliver, in his way, embraces them as well. Things get weird, then things get surprising, but it's a joyous, neon-lit, loud-soundtrack film full of beauty, treachery, and debauchery, befitting the long English tradition of such. It has been a long time I have felt something, after Saltburn I was chocked in ways I have not been in years. Great actors and beautifully filmed. Depressing, depraved and pretty disgusting Saltburn is wild, dark, disturbing and absolutely delightful, and I really can't explain why I enjoyed this wild ride of a story as much as I did. It's like ‚ÄòSuccession' meets ‚ÄòRocky Horror.' Plus, the retro song list is a hoot; from T. Pain to the Pet Shop Boys, and a song I somehow missed in the 2000s, ‚ÄòMurder on the Dance Floor' by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Now I can't get that earworm song out of my head. 

Two thumbs way way up. A psychological thriller drama with twits they imply are coming but still leave you surprised The best movie I've seen all year Best movie of the year easily I wasn't gonna bother going to watch this I thought just another boring English movie but it was really good great acting great story can't believe it's British movie The ride is decent enough but very predictable. You know what is going on before the movie decides to tell you what is going on.  It tries so hard but alas it does not surprise. This movie made me physically ill. It seems some are fans of that feeling. Not for me. I haven‚Äôt been religious since I was a child but I may burn some palo santo and say a prayer tonight. The freak deadass ate his way to the top( and I meant that literally and figuratively)"
Comedy,the_holdovers,"...a deliberate yet increasingly enthralling drama... This is Mr. Hunham rediscovering his dignity and purpose, and it is Payne delivering his masterpiece the eighth time out... Their circumstances initially seem obvious, but David Hemingson‚Äôs script turns in a few twists, leaving in a bit of edge while maintaining an overall sense of warmth‚Äîthe kind that makes nice holiday viewing. Working from a script from David Hemingson, Payne has crafted a wonderful story of loneliness and isolation that manages to be both inspirational and uplifting.  ‚Ä¶ you leave the theatre with a renewed sense of what it really means to be human. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is amazing in this as well. The uncommon movie these days that really does earn laughs and tears. A touching drama that infuses acerbic wit with sincere platonic love, convincingly delivered by Giamatti, Randolph, and newcomer Sessa. The comedy is perfectly blended with loneliness, producing a memorable story that can make you laugh and cry. The performances by these three lead actors are all superb, and they had to be in order for this movie to work this well with such a small cast.  Whether it‚Äôs putting your money where your mouth is or refusing to stay on the sidelines, people make the right choice if their convictions are true, consequences be damned: the essence of being a Barton man. There are surprises to be found in The Holdovers, but they come from the characters, not the story ‚Äî from the ways each of the three main figures reveals new depths and confounds expectations. In Payne‚Äôs work, one individual‚Äôs foibles and failings can open another‚Äôs perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director‚Äôs greatest films. The way Paul Giamatti tip toes between teacher, paternal figure, friend and even combatant is nothing short of sublime. Hunham‚Äôs hero Marcus Aurelius once wrote, ‚ÄúGive thyself leisure to learn some good thing.‚Äù Take his advice and see this film. The Holdovers delivers in every way. It is a genuine and heart-warming story with complex characters. Paul Giamatti gives his most memorable performance to date, and this is arguably Payne‚Äôs best work.
 There‚Äôs something elastic to Giamatti‚Äôs performance as Mr. Hunham, particularly in his face: he never lacks a wide-eyed stare or a clenched jaw; it‚Äôs a masterpiece of miserly annoyance, he‚Äôs the king of put-upon stiffs. The Holdovers, after being stuck in the snow for too much of its more-than-two-hour runtime, does eventually land in an emotionally satisfying place. The best way to describe Payne‚Äôs ninth feature is to say it‚Äôs remarkably ordinary. A quality that applies to most of his films that are warm, quiet, and inherently funny meditations about unexceptional people leading a simple life. There are so many touching and subtle scenes in this film. So well done.  Alexander Payne has created a wonderful holiday movie about finding a sense of family and caring for others in the least expected places.","Extremely well acted, and emotionally resonant. A satisfying ending to an overall heartfelt story. The Holdovers holds you over its two hours with beautifully flawed characters and a story simple but oh-so-effective at evoking a wheelhouse of emotions. The Holdovers is a rare movie nowadays, with its sincerely human story and layered characters. It's a believable movie that makes you feel various emotions, from laugh-out-loud happy to teary-eyed sad. The actors were remarkable in showcasing the dimensionality of their roles, especially Paul Giamatti, who gave an incredible performance. It's also beautifully shot with a vintage look that resembles the feel of 90s movies. It is mellow, however, and the slow pace of events can get dull, but it remains an enjoyable movie. This is a good coming of age story set at a new england boarding school in the 1970s with interesting characters. Holdovers is a delightful movie for those who like leave the theater just a little different than when they walked in, with a slightly different perception of life and the values we hold dear.  A thought-provoking movie with layers of messages. The casting is perfect, the storyline is emotionally packed with humor and wit. Loved it! This is one of the best Christmas movies I've seen so far. I thought there were really excellent messages, about family that were really strong, and will probably resonate with most people during the holidays, and I thought the comedy was amazing. I was laughing through the entire movie. The acting was also excellent, and it had the charm of a classic 90s Christmas movie while still modernizing it a little bit. By the end of the film, I was in the Christmas spirit. That's why I recommend putting The Holdovers on your wish list to watch this year. An instant classic. This movies captures a myriad of human emotion: comedy, happiness, jealousy, and heartbreak to name a few. A must watch this holiday season! Loved it!Excellent story, acting and screenplay. Not an Alexander Payne fan but I really loved this movie.  It captures the feel and look of the 70s while exploring themes that resonated then and now.  Excellent acting across the board. It's rare to see a movie just sit with itself anymore. Everything has to be such huge set pieces or some larger than life situation but not here. In many ways this movie is a refreshing throwback to the era I'm which it's set. Just a movie about people being people. I know this isn't going to win any Oscars but it definitely deserves them all the same. Well written. Reminiscent of a good John Irving novel. This generations less-polished, more real Dead Poets Society. Lovely, warm-hearted and lovable. Giamatti as always brings so much more to the show than what he is given on the page. What's here is good you just wish there was a little bit more. Only the teacher and pupil flesh out at all the other characters are 2-dimensional. A strong freshman effort? Or one and done true-to-life tale with nothing else in the creativity tank?  Capture the 70s tone perfectly but too reliant on long close-ups of thoughtfully posed actors. You start to feel like an awkward wallflower at the party struggling for something to say which may be the point of this comIng of age film. A very well crafted and touching story with great performances. Pitiful at times but elating overall. A very entertaining watch. The Holdovers might have just become my favorite film of the year. There is something magical in the simplicity of showing flawed characters from all angles. All of the film's elements come together to, essentially, demonstrate the magic of Christmas without the sticky, sappiness that so many others rely on. Instead, we are woven a tale that feels simple and real, driven by satisfyingly paced character and relationship growth. I can not recommend this enough, especially for the holidays and for folks who are suckers for a found family. Job well done to all who worked on this film! Poor writing, weak acting. Nothing new to see here. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen other times. I really enjoyed this movie. It is a little slow at the beginning, but is really intriguing beautiful story with great characters. It feels like it will be a christmas classic. Great Christmas movie! Gets your heart Terrific film that grabs your heart Believable human stories. Exceptional. Paul G is truly one of a kind. One of the best movies I saw in 2023. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. It really transported me back to the 70's and in loved every minute of it.  
I can't wait to see it again. The three performances by Giamatti, Randolph and Sessa make the film. One can argue that a few script contrivances (the process by which ""Angus"" gets left behind a prime example) trip the narrative up a bit but it's the three actors - especially Sessa, in a remarkable debut - carry the film to it's emotionally satisfying conclusion. Giamatti mines every once of nuance out of the curmudgeonly History professor and Randolph can do more with one gtare than most actresses working. Most definitely worth your time!"
Comedy,poor_things,"Poor Things is a movie of unsavory urges and scratched itches that pull the viewer down a pernicious drain of unconscionable behavior. There's a dark comedy buried in the muck that curdles to the surface as our lead becomes the master of her own fate. Enjoyable, weird, bonkers and smart. What makes Poor Things a titanic‚Äîand undoubtedly long-remembered‚Äîfilm is how Lanthimos balances playfulness with far more intricate themes.  Pulling from horror, science-fiction, romance, and coming-of-age genres, Bella Baxter‚Äôs story is an enrapturing, sophisticated, deeply feminist one: Lanthimos firing on all cylinders.  Beautifully garish, wonderfully twisted, unabashedly raunchy and at times grotesquely striking... Poor Things is the latest evidence that it‚Äôs Lanthimos‚Äô‚Äîand Stone‚Äôs‚ÄîMojo Dojo Casa House. The rest of us are just living in it. Screenwriter Tony McNamara deserves credit for wrestling Gray's novel into a movie that Lanthimos fills with visual invention, twisted wit, and bizarre surprises. Poor Things constantly draws its viewers into an unpredictable story of self-discovery that is filled with unbridled creativity and brilliant acting, [Full review in Spanish] Emma Stone shines in film bogged down by third-act lectures on the Patriarchy. Emma Stone dazzles in this bizarre and wondrous fairytale. Stone‚Äôs performance is exceptional, sincerely portraying Bella‚Äôs development from infant to mature young woman... Director Yorgos Lanthimos‚Äô film has all the makings to be one of the year‚Äôs best pictures  I never thought I'd want to see an R-rated Disney Princess film by Yorgos Lanthimos and after seeing this, I still don't.  Who knew Yorgos Lanthimos was the new James Whale. All hail the Bella Baxer of Emma Stone, she's alive alive. Yorgos Lanthimos' 'Poor Creatures' is a twisted version of Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. But also, an exploration of female sexuality, maturity and evil, in the midst of a dark comedy. [Full Review in Spanish] Stone commands each and every scene in which she appears (which is very nearly every scene in the movie), and I strongly suspect that Bella Baxter will go down in the pantheon of unforgettable screen characters. Lanthimos takes the social experiment from his breakthrough film Dogtooth in a more crowd-pleasing and comforting direction. Through it all, Bella claims center stage; and whether she‚Äôs acting as an innocent or a sophisticate, Stone has no problem anchoring the chaos. unmatched as a visual experience, not as jolly as Lanthimo‚Äôs The Lobster, but exquisite, clever, reasonable, and masterful, whisking us away to new ideas, but be warned, it‚Äôs a lot.
 The narrative feels long, but the themes and character growth we're shown are tragic, beautiful, and marvelously gripping. You'll be blown away by the beauty of the visuals, but even more entranced by the magnetism of Stone. If not all parts coalesce into a fully successful whole, the cinematic recipe is still a delectable feast worthy of careful consumption.","I am not a fan of child/disability porn, which is essentially what this movie was. If someone's brain is of an infant/child but their body is an adult it's creepy at the very least. ""Poor Things"" might just be one of the best films not only of the year, but of the decade. Yorgos CONTINUES to be the goat with his adaptation of Alastair Gray's original book, and his style, the production design, the weirdly morphed animals, and the mechanics of this world are all unforgettable. The score from Jerskin Fendrix is most definitely my favorite of the year, and it certainly has my hope for an Oscar win. Emma Stone gives the greatest performance of her career, Mark Ruffalo plays a great bumbling manipulator, Christopher Abbott plays an amazing goat, and Willem Dafoe absolutely kills his role again. Everybody in the cast and crew knew the assignment. This is an absolutely portrait perfect, gorgeously shot and edited film that had the upmost care contributed to it. This film is one of the many reasons why I love cinema. Time flew watching this movie. If you know the directors past work then you know why.  You might not like everything that happens but dammit you will be entertained. Very enjoyable and full of fun shocking moments. I can't stop thinking about this movie. Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Willem Dafoe all give amazing performances. Incredible to look at as well. It has so much to say on so many levels I don't even know where to start. Witty, visually stunning, touching, and one of Lanthimos‚Äô best. Waited months to see it. The movie is a piece of art and needs time and space to be analyzed. Not for people who go to movies for purely entertainment or thrills I‚Äôve seen 50 movies this year at the theater. This is by far the worst movie of the year. I walked out. I never walk out of movies. I love the movie and cat was great Absolutely not. 2 hours of watching Emma Stone act as a mentally delayed individual, then act as a child getting railed over and over. Visuals and script are the only saving grace of this film. The entire film was uncomfortable and boring. Never left a movie review for any movie but had  to warn anyone thinking about seeing this disaster of a moviedont do itlove Emma Stone  but not sure why she stooped so low to make this bizarre degrading movie. Absolutely the worst movie, we shouldve left when the couple next to us walked out about an hour in, but thought it would get better, unfortunately got about 10 times worse. Beautiful movie! Production designer deserves an Oscar. Best screenplay from book, best cinematography, best actress, best film. A movie for the puke-vomit bucket list. Nearly one of the worst movies ever made, and I'm very sad to see Emma Stone play the role she did in this distressing and god-awful pile of garbage projected onto a movie screen. I'm actually very sad to see she would have accepted to play such a terrible role. Emma has done some excellent roles that I love and cherish, but this one was a role you should hope to see end up in the round file and never do such filth again, no matter what the paycheck is. I love that some people absolutely hated this, thas because it's not a movie, it's a FILM and its not for simple minded people with short attention span I absolutely loved it! Emma stone is PUURRRFECTION AND DAFOE KILLS IT AS USUAL! HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FOR MONTHS AND IT DIDNT DISAPPOINT Horrible. Weird. Stranger than strange. Good acting cant save this movie. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.  Had to walk out before it was over. Great performances all around ( Oscar worthy). Lots of smart and mature laughs. This movie is not for everyone its a hard R Bella like.  Almost as good as furious jumping Such a gorgeous film, Emma Stone gives the performance of a lifetime and is just absolutely spectacular! Bizarre film!  But that's typical for Yorgos Lanthimos.  Not for the faint-hearted or those that tend to like more mainstream movies.  Emma Stone gives the performance of a lifetime and Willem Defoe gives ones of his best ever.  If you've liked this director's other films, don't skip this one. Amazing film. Epic unique story with tremendous performances especially by Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo."
Comedy,dream_scenario,"'Dream Scenario' by director Kristoffer Borgli and starring Nicolas Cage, explores instant celebrity and also, mass hatred. All through an allegory of celebrity with surrealistic overtones. [Full Review in Spanish]
 It rides on the success of the right performer pulling it off, and the actor‚Äôs own public persona helps‚Äîseasoned movie watchers know to expect something beyond the ordinary from Nicolas Cage and he proves true to form with the intriguing and strange... I still had fun with the film; it just crashed into a brick wall right when it seemed like it was hitting its stride and preparing to deliver the punch-line. DREAM SCENARIO features a compelling concept that at times is really intriguing, but sadly it's often at odds with the film's commentary on pop culture fads. It's a cunning take on media, both social and traditional, as well as pop culture. Director Kristoffer Borgli avoids tarting up his film with flashy CGI, schtick or an overly imposing score. He stands back and lets Cage do his brilliant best. ‚Ä¶ an engaging enough experience while it‚Äôs happening, but one that you‚Äôll likely have trouble recalling when you wake up the next morning. Cage‚Äôs is a tremendous performance that anchors a very good film, a bitter pill chased with a tart cider. ‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt an entirely satisfying film, struggling to balance media satire with an intense personal journey  but Cage‚Äôs memorably agonising performance makes it worth hearing out for anyone concerned about the shallow direction of today‚Äôs online discourse‚Ä¶ While some of these threads are incompletely developed and others dropped entirely, Dream Scenario never collapses in formless entropy thanks in large part to Cage's open-hearted embrace of his character. ...doesn‚Äôt quite know where to go with its high concept. Thematically, Dream Scenario perhaps poses more questions than it is able to effectively answer. Nicolas Cage delivers a wonderful performance in ‚ÄúDream Scenario,‚Äù a quirky dark comedy with fantasy and horror elements. This is only writer/director Borgli‚Äôs second feature after numerous shorts; he‚Äôs clearly a talent to watch for. Part social commentary on instant fame and fast celebrities, Dream Scenario is a wild ride of The Floor is Lava, where the floor is everyday life and the lava is an incessant 24-hour news cycle supplemented by quick-hit socials like Reels and TikTok. An edgy satire about modern celebrity that, as happens so often nowadays, stumbles toward the close but offers so much that‚Äôs good along the way that you forgive its third-act lapses. The good certainly includes Cage‚Äôs witty performance.   Dream Scenario takes a cautionary look at celebrity and cancel culture as it traces the fantastical plight of a nondescript, bespectacled, bald and bearded biology professor named Paul, hilariously brought to life by Nicolas Cage. Dream Scenario is worth watching for its clever premise alone, and the casting of Cage is inspired. The first act is the strongest, and as the narrative shifts to the third act, it loses sight of its thesis. The structure may challenge some viewers, but those who stay engaged will find plenty of awkwardness offering a distinct cinematic pleasure. It has more to say than anticipated, and while the message doesn‚Äôt feel fully explored, there is an originality to this concept that remains intriguing throughout. The way it seamlessly shifts between genres is impressive.","quirky story hilarious at times! Good Cage performance. Leaves the audience with an unsettled feeling, which is a positive. I didn't mind the farting scene, but overall I felt like the story could've used a good deal of tightening up. An ordinary man shows up in the dreams of millions doing seemingly nothing making him a celebrity of sorts. Then suddenly the same man turns violent in the dreams of millions of people & becomes rejected by society for something he never did. Being a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman and Ari Aster, I absolutely loved this. Can't stop thinking about it. And one of Cage's best acting performances. this was a strange, strange movie lmao. nic cage was easily one of my favorite parts of this movie - he was great as this awkward, ""everyday"" professor-turned-celebrity, and all of the little quirks he gave this character had me laughing constantly. most of the jokes in this movie hit for me, and i loved all of the dream sequences as well. they had a really entertaining comedy-horror blend to them.

however, i found the first half to be stronger than the second - by the time the second half came around, i felt like the plot started to wander a little bit and i wasn't really satisfied with where we ended up by the time the credits rolled. there's a lot of great commentary on fame, cancel culture, and capitalist profiteering as well, but i think those ideas would've landed better with a stronger ending, and i think paul's journey as a character would be more meaningful too.

that being said, i still had a smile on my face for a whole lot of this movie, and the first half was fantastic. with a great lead and lots of humor and creativity, i'd say to at least give it a shot, even if you don't enjoy it as much as i do. I think this is a critics movie. One that makes you think just enough to seem profound, but really just tries to hard in the end. Speaking of the end I think this movie would have received maybe one more star if the ending was not so terrible. Overall, it is the odd movie that I am glad I saw but would probably not recommend to others. Nicolas Cage and A24 was not the Dream I thought it would be I suppose using Nicolas Cage‚Äôs name will draw/lure an audience? Nicolas Cage really shines in this movie where he can easily share all the torments, flaws and awkwardness of his character while going more crazy in the dream sequence. The premise is so creative and offers great opportunity to play with drama, humor, surrealism and horror. 

Despite all of this, the movie fell flat here and there. It's mostly due to long scenes that while very funny at first stretches the joke to a boring point. The story doesn't take full advantage of its surrealist premise most of the dream lack imaginative visuals that you would expect from it. 

It's important to know that this movie is mostly an allegory about cancel culture but in the case when the victim who loose everything is not guilty of what he is accusing of. It shows how difficult you can apologize for something that you didn't do but still ruin your reputation and your life. It is an interesting and tricky point of view but this focus slows down the movie that should a use more of visual creativity and let us suffering with a character that just being unfairly hated without any chance to recover. It's a good take on not only the real life lore behind a man who was frequently popping up in dreams, but also how some of us feel so unseen and unheard in life and how that desire can go awry. 


The main character is pretty passive and bland, so when he finds out he's the exact way in dreams, it's deeply upsetting to him. He longs to be exciting, memorable, an active member of these dreams... then he meets the one exception to this, which is where the film takes a darker turn. There are many different meanings to this film (as with all art) and I find myself engaging with all of my thoughts of it. 
Recommended watch. Made me think. Made me feel for all the characters.  Great movie to talk about afterwards. Not the Nick Cage I grew up with, so glad he made this movie. Very A24. Not super dark. If you‚Äôre a Nick Cage fan and an A24 fan I‚Äôll really like this one. Still  deeply thinking about it Interesting idea‚Ä¶. Nicholas Cage was perfect for this role. It was just ok. Love Movies that Feature Music by The Talking Heads. Dream Scenario is a good social commentary on fame and the damages that come with that. But it is difficult to care about the film's main character‚Äî making it difficult to care about the film as a whole. A funny, beautiful, and eloquently delivered satire. Loved every minute of it Provocative and seductive!  Well crafted to keep you involved and guessing! movie with a message....stop worshipping celebrities! Highly original, unpredictable, excellent flow, leading to a topical finale, humanity chooses to live in a dream enabled by technology, though some would really like it to be real. As easy as in a dream celebrities are made then destroyed, hero to villain transformation according to public perception. It's a movie with many layers. Cage is absolutely brilliant.  Another Oscar can be expected for him for this role."
Comedy,love_actually,"... Curtis and company remind us that love, actually, is everywhere no matter the time of year, period, or place. That‚Äôs what helps make it a staple watch this and any other time of year. A cringe 10 for the price of one bulk holiday sale of the most well-worn rom-com tropes. The film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested.  Richard Curtis‚Äô Love Actually claims the prize of being the ‚Äúultimate romantic comedy‚Äù not through daring or originality, but by covering every clich√© imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style. ...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics... The work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life. A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish. It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations. A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand. It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies. Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them. There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy. The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking. Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two. This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments. Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire. Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers. If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock. Out of the cacophony of other, newly minted love affairs that promise eternal love forever and ever, theirs stand out like a winter fern among hothouse roses, adding a much-needed zest to the bouquet. Love Actually provides enough happy endings to make the audience forget that romance and Christmas miracles don't always work out.","Read how much everyone loved this movie, especially at Christmas, so my wife & I watched.  It's a total cheeseball that may have been OK when released but doesn't hold up today at all.  I want my two hours back. An enduring holiday classic worth watching every year. ‚ÄúThe Brits are coming; the Brit‚Äôs are coming!‚Äù Extremely cheesy, hasn't held up well, bad plot lines. In fact really isn't a plot. Couldn't wait for it to end. Got to see it as a 20th anniversary showing on the big screen and so glad I did!  What a fun romp that was!  Here I am seeing it 20 years after the fact and find it was one of the freshest Rom Com's I've ever seen!  I mean, who'd have thought the likes of Alan Rickman & Liam Neeson would be in a movie playing such sympathetic characters!  And Rowan Atkinson's cameo was a hoot as was Bill Nighy's portrayal of an aging bad boy rock star!  And no, we're not forgetting the ""birds"" (in keeping with the British vernacular) as led by Emma Thompson and Laura Linney.  But the actress who stole my heart and was the object of desire for both Prime Ministers and Presidents, was Martine McCutcheon as a working class cutie, Natalie.  Although you can certainly see why someone would fall for their best friend's gal when they are played by the beautiful Keira Knightley.  This is the perfect film to take your honey to, and let the magic of this Christmas Rom Com do the rest! Love Actually gives too much time to certain plot lines, while not giving enough attention to others. The thread that ties all of the stories together is not tight enough. My favorite Christmas movie! Like how the stories intermingle and catch something new every time I watch.  You really need to rent and watch on a streaming service to get the real dialogue or too much will be cut.  This movie will make you laugh and cry several times.  A great mingling of rom-coms! ""Love Actually"" the ultimate romantic comedy? Sure it plays out like a comedy but it also has some bits of drama including an Academy Award¬Æ nominee performance by Emma Thompson. The story is about how love effects everyone around not just a single person. Even if the plot of the movie drags on for quite a bit the star studded cast is the redeeming part of this holiday comedy. Can't decide if I want to give this 4 or 4.5 stars. The highs are high, but the lows are dull. The movie could do with like 3 less stories, and it would be a lot shorter and cleaner. Regardless, here's my rankings:

9. John and Judy
8. Sarah and Karl
7. Juliet and the boys
6. Colin!
5. Billy Mack
4. Harry and Karen and Mia
3. Jaime and Aurelia
2. Prime Minister
1. Liam Neeson and the boy

Odd that there is narration at the airport at the beginning of the movie but not at the end. Not my cup of tea but my wife loved it Simply a great Christmas movie! Nothing better than an ensemble cast film made up of the best British actors. While the story is overzealous in parts, with too many characters and stories, the calibre of the cast more than makes up for its ambition. Worth a watch every Christmas.üéÑ Perfect in every way. It is a ""little boxes""movie.
Trite.
I HATED Laura Linney's character. HATED.
I did like Claudia's cameo. It's a fun movie; we watch it every year. Meh, it felt like a waist of time but the wife was ok with it.  Most of the storylines are ridiculous and sleep inducing.  I know this is a holiday classic for many people, but never again for me. Must see at Christmas. A series of individual stories that all intertwine to a wonderful and warming conclusion. Some moments hit hard, some will lift via well timed light harted comedy. The cast and acting, give it a longevity that stands the test of time. Love Actually turn into a great xmas movie. Ensemble cast is great. My least favorite story line is Hugh Grant as The British PM. I I love getting to see all the separate stories intertwine with one another. Love Actually is a warm lighthearted film. Everyone does a great job and it's the perfect story of ups and downs through relationships and the holidays"
Comedy,next_goal_wins_2023,"Although some of the jokes may be somewhat funny, the truth is that this has more to do with the performer's charisma than with the lazy script. [Full review in Spanish] Amidst full euphoria for the anniversary of the consecration of La Scaloneta, Next Goal Wins is the right film. [Full review in Spanish] It's not a holiday film at all, but it has that spirit.  While there isn't anything too revolutionary or revealing in this comedy, Next Goal Wins plays out pleasantly and with a playful spirit that's most appreciated. [Full review in Spanish] The team, the league and the coach behind it all seems like a genuinely inspirational backbone to this film but Taika's over-the-top, although funny when it strikes properly, humor belittles an otherwise motivational tale. We know what to expect going into Next Goal Wins, and, yes, Waititi‚Äôs take on a sports movie is both chock full of chuckles and intermittently frustrating. Two yellow cards for the hackneyed feel-good farce. Next Goal Wins is rushed in almost every way ... While sweet at times, it doesn't have that laugh-out-loud moment that Taika often brings to the table. Based on the American Samoa soccer team‚Äôs comeback from a devastating loss (31-0) to Australia, it shows what a new coach did to rally the dejected. In other words, it‚Äôs a southern hemisphere ‚ÄúTed Lasso.‚Äù While Next Goal Wins follows the traditional structure of the sports movie (it all leads to the Big Game), it undermines the genre from within. It‚Äôs even narratively adventurous: fourth walls get broken and critical junctures are dealt with offhandedly. This is the straightest, almost least Taikery of the Taika films, but it still marches to the beat of his drum. For the most part it's a very jovial and upbeat film.  There are many charming moments in this movie, and a lot of funny stuff.  Does provide some cheery, if predictable, family viewing, but it lacks originality and that certain special spark that made the director‚Äôs earlier films, such as Boy, so delightfully, laugh-out-loud funny. The fact is, the movie has nothing new to offer other than the typical cliche-filled sports picture. Next Goal Wins certainly isn‚Äôt a terrible outing, nor is it unwatchable; it just doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as challenging or risky as most of what Waititi has given us before, and from someone like him, that‚Äôs a shame. Next Goal Wins is generic and impersonal compared to the likes of Waititi‚Äôs Boy (2010) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016). Blending dry humor, broad physical bits, and quirky characters, this film has all the makings of a familiar sports story designed to make the audience smile, laugh, and appreciate the mild bouts of drama that filter through. owever, the film avoids any ""White Savior"" narrative, with Waititi championing the team's own cultural identity as their key to success rather than any brilliant tactics by their ""Palagi"" or White coach.  Filmmaker Taika Waititi makes the most of the Pacific island setting, a witty script and a cast of engaging actors. So even if there isn't much underlying resonance in how the events unfold, the story is able to remain buoyant.","Completely enjoyed this film. I took a group of 7 cousins, ranging from 10years old - mid to late teens including us in our 30s and every single person loved it! We all walked out of the theatre with big smiles on our faces and non stop chatter about it in the car ride home. I think, if you liked the 90s Movie Cool Runnings, then you'll love this movie. It's funny yes, somewhat satirical but I think that's a cultural thing... I know somewhat of a sensitive topic, but we went into the movie with no expectations and walked out thoroughly entertained! A rare misfire from writer-director Taika Waititi whose films I had generally liked, this based-on-a-true-story sports underdog movie is mostly a Ted Lasso-like retread of Cool Runnings with minor topical updates. After a humiliating defeat, the terrible American Samoa national football team, who has yet to score one international goal, gets Michael Fassbender's Dutch-American Thomas Rongen, who has personal baggage of his own, as their coach and 4 weeks to shape themselves up before an imminent World Cup qualifier match. Beginning less than promisingly with an unnecessary and unfunny introduction by Waititi in full Samoan priest garb, which strikes a wrong note with me from the start, there's nothing here that surprises as its main narrative unfolds. Except for a well-handled and almost touching subplot with Kaimana's transsexual player Jaiyah, which is the one ingredient here that makes this feels 2023, even if these events took place more than a decade ago. A conventional IKEA assembly of a movie, occasionally interrupted by Waitiki's irreverent sense of humour, the player's eccentricities, and their distinctive Samoan-ism are heightened for comedic effect, but at times it can come dangerously close to the film laughing at, rather than with, them. Nevertheless, those parts are the main reasons why anyone will warm to the story, while a somewhat lost Fassbender do his best to keep out of the way of the film. Ultimately, it just doesn't quite gel together despite the almighty efforts of a frothy script and Waititi's sparkling direction to make this as spiritually uplifting as possible and that inevitably feelgood ending feels more like a fluke-ish one-off accident rather than genuine character development or growth. Just about watchable as a piece of crowd-pleasing escapism for an undemanding audience looking for a bit of laid back Samoan sunshine and positivity in their lives. Definitely feel good movie of 2023. It was like cool runnings but of football Taika Waititi is back. After the tragic events of Thor Love and Thunder, the man has risen from the ashes and gone to a more smaller simpler story, full of happiness. This was such a fun movie, I had a fun time, many many laughs, for me and my friends. This is a film you will enjoy watching with friends and family, it is one of those movies that just brings a joyful time. Was it the greatest film, no, but I didn't want it to be. I just wanted a fun enjoyable movie, and that is what I got. The story was cool, very funny. The cast and the performances were excellent, really good. You get some good emotions from this movie. A couple moments where I was like yeah ok didn't really need that but ok. Overall a very fun movie. Apart from being touching and beautiful and funny, remember overhead projectors and those plastic strip doorway things, there was a deep theological touch imbedded in this film that I thought was genius. Did you notice what it was? Grass roots. Shows how a nation of physically large people, who can resist, has so much joy in their lives that all they need is one soccer goal to complete it. To fulfill it. Really funny, sweet and touching movie. Wasn't half bad. Very paint by numbers but situated in an interesting location. BITCOIN RECOVERY MADE EASY BY LOST RECOVERY MASTERS

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did. Feel good quirky underdog story that sometimes misses with its humour and drama but mostly succeeds, especially in its final act. Whether you care about the sport or not, this should still be fun. This movie was exactly what it should be. It told a good story and featured a lot of different big ideas.  I enjoyed the character development even though it was hard to see the end of the movie at the beginning of the movie.  My only real bag was that the story hit the target with a slug and not a bullet.  It felt a bit more diverse when it came to multiple storylines. Funny, heartfelt, and just a real feel-good movie with some good performances. it was funny underdog sports movie, surprised to learn it was based off a true true story It's a good movie with good comedy that is well written Caught this at a Screen Unseen showing this evening and I'm really struggling to find anything vaguely redeeming about it as a film. I love a lot of Taika's work but this unfortunately is a really stinker. Haven't laughed so much at the cinema in ages. Some really memorable characters and quotes. A sweet and uplifting story accessible to those who don't watch football/sports movies but refreshingly new for fans of them. Funny and touching with a total original story, even following the an old formula I laughed and cried. This is truly a great movie with a big heart. Taika Waititi is one of my favorites. My wife and I both love this movie. I especially like the courageous stance Taika Waititi takes by casting Kaimana, a transgender actress who is a fa ªafafine (a third gender widely accepted in American Samoa and Samoa). The movie is about the worst soccer team in history. The team gets a new Dutch coach who is confused and upset by the presence of a transgender player, Jaiyah Saelua, based on a real life person. The Samoans accept and even admire her. The leader of the Samoan Soccer Association explains:  Imagine the world without flowers. The fa ªafafine are our flowers. Taika Waititi Has the courage to stand up to the haters. This is a beautiful movie that you will love. Look I was expecting to see a funny movie like Cool Runnings and although it did have a couple of good laughs. I felt like it was pushing social norms that I do support and family values that are at odds with mine. In the future I'll be avoiding all movies from this director and actors in this film. Not what I was expecting and I wish I didn't purchase the ticket. Rotten tomatoes got this wrong (again). This movie was fantastic."
Comedy,fallen_leaves,"There is a Kaursim√§ki wonderland. He finds it in those unpromising, frosty, ashtray-littered locations. Fallen Leaves is one of the most wondrous of his films, and one of the simplest.  P√∂ysti delivers a small wonder of a performance, and turns her Ansa into a graceful symbol of survival. The filmmaking mimics the characters‚Äô stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. In Kaurism√§ki's world, love (and of course, friendship) are the default solutions to survive a gray life, a mediocre job, and an inferior salary. [Full review in Spanish] Fallen Leaves delivers a lot in a short time. It's a story that finds a warm glow in an unlike;ly setting.  Kaurism√§ki‚Äôs latest sees him once again melding deadpan drama, pinpoint humor, and warm humanism into something refreshingly classical and true to his form. Faced with a bruised and battered world, Fallen Leaves merely soothes it, and that‚Äôs enough; of all the movies released in 2023, it‚Äôs the one with the most humane, satisfying ache. P√∂ysti is pitch-perfect throughout as a careworn woman with poetry deep down, as Ibsen said of Hedda Gabler.  The film has everything you would expect from the Finnish ironist: cool movie posters and retro pop ballads about love and heartache drifting out against a post-industrial backdrop of foundries and forklifts... Fallen Leaves runs for 82 perfect minutes, which in an era of overblown epics that numb your posterior, makes it a total joy.  With its droll, deadpan humour and poignant central story of two lonely souls connecting, it‚Äôs the closest Kaurism√§ki gets to a feelgood movie (albeit a feelgood movie with incipient liver failure). The twists and turns of Fallen Leaves aren‚Äôt so out of the ordinary, but they‚Äôre so exaggerated by the perplexity of its main characters as to constantly invite big laughs and unsure snickers in equal measure.

 'Fallen Leaves' feels just right, as if the universe itself had a deadpan sense of humor, playing a teasing game with the lovers.  Kaurism√§ki‚Äôs film manages a rare feat -- to be simultaneously touching and ironic. DROLL, sentimental, and quietly funny, this tale of two everyday Finns and their prosaic love story can‚Äôt fail to raise a smile. It‚Äôs a slight but captivating film, played with deadpan wit by Poysti and Vatanen. It‚Äôs a quiet, sweet, witty, moving Finnish-language drama about a relationship that slowly develops...  What is also familiar to fans of the director is the wry humor and impassive affect of so many of the characters. Underneath it all, however, beats a heart eager for love. Drolly scripted, impeccably designed and photographed, and played to succinct perfection, this may only be a slender drama, but it's also a cherishable summation of what makes Aki Kaurism√§ki special. P√∂ysti and Vatanen are perfect as familiar archetypes who still ring true. ","Kaurismaki with the same formula, same type of story, same type of characters, same type of dialogue and situations, same type of atmosphere.... And even then, it feels refreshing every time. It doesn't get tired. It always works. A delightful cinema Short: perfectly mellow.
Long: Hi. I hope and trust you're well. 
So this film is not true. But what it does do, is to make time, to focus on different acting techniques.
What happens? Un-spoiler alert. I'm still not sure, but I feel it is generally understood? that if one sees a lot of a character, that that character narrates the piece? Boy meets girl.
Opinion pls.
- With no real wish to make everything about my pet theory, this film is fine... 
-but the timing of it sort of makes it part of the fetish of Christmas...
-and so, that it is in Finnish, could be seen/ or heard as - Winter! brings to mind... the people of North Europe! 
-who are not Teddy's bears.
-Also. Thank you.
PS. So I had an experience, when I went along and spoke with someone- and the penny just dropped that whereas I'd spent my formative years at the cinema, he'd been doing some form of work. So. People just don't pick up my references. So this throws me into a quandary ... I think you have got to beware, that too many in-jokes spoil the universality of a piece. meaning, here- call the dog Chaplin, the couple's first dates are at an art-house cinema... That may well be a world the director feels comfortable in. (but if these characters are everymen everywomen everyperson, then not everyone goes to the cinema.) I loved the  deadpan humor in this film, along with the two quirky characters who just can't seem to stay employed. A strong undercurrent of barely expressed emotion and need for connection. It's visually gorgeous, every frame a treasure. It's not much of a secret that the worldview of Finnish society can be more than a little bleak. At the same time, though, it also possesses an understatedly campy, eminently whimsical quality that comes in stark contrast to this otherwise-dour outlook. And this makes for a combination of traits that can be somewhat puzzling to fathom, especially to outsiders. That's the quirky social conundrum that writer-director Aki Kaurism√§ki seeks to capture in his latest offering, a wry comedy-drama focused on the lives of two lonely, lovelorn working class Helsinki residents (Alma P√∂ysti, Jussi Vatanen) who struggle against life's hiccups while seeking to forge a romance. But, in telling their story, the filmmaker has difficulty finding sufficient traction to engage viewers. We witness a story full of modest, garden variety ups and downs, as well as more than a few miscommunications, experiences we've all no doubt undergone ourselves from time to time. However, is that enough to make a compelling picture? It certainly doesn't feel that way much of the time, given its wooden dialogue and restrained, sometimes-stilted performances, no matter how pointedly this production may portray the nature of this extraordinarily reserved people. To its credit, the film works best when it pokes fun at the nature of Finnish culture, providing some delicious nuggets of droll humor, backed by a diverse yet spot-on soundtrack that fittingly and ironically complements what's unfolding on screen. Nevertheless, there's so much here that lends so little to a narrative that just never catches fire that it's hard to imagine almost anyone generating any interest in, or enthusiasm for, the protagonists and their feeble attempts at launching a relationship. Maybe I'm missing something here, but, if there is something meaningful that this release is trying to convey, it's apparently well buried under one of those big piles of fallen leaves that give this picture its title. It's a strange movie. it has the feel of being amateur, but actually works. Many people have used the word quirky - it is. Everything is dull, the characters, weather and scenery. You don't feel you are looking at actors. But it keeps you smiling, and the music/songs are good. If it turns up on streaming, I'll watching it again.

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did. This movie was amazing. It has a short run time which is refreshing out alongside the other releases that consistently go above two hours. My whole theater was laughing at the dry pan humor and the out of time feel really made the movie very tense. It was a very enjoyable experience that will make you leave with a smile. Absolute masterpiece. Refined portray of real life and how tragic and comedic it can be. Oddball romantic deadpan comedy with nice cinematography. Slow paced but enough there to keep your interest throughout. It has a 90's look to it which I liked, overall I enjoyed it a lot! It's hard to imagine that this is a movie in 2023: except for the Russo-Ukrainian war on the radio, and the hard and hopeless life... The sadness and romance of middle-aged- lovers... Aki's cold humor and music taste are off the charts, comfortable and ironing . (There were many elderly audiences sitting in the old theater, and they laughed from time to time. Maybe the sense of the times in the film is the youth they are familiar with) A delight.  A deceptively simple piece of filmmaking featuring music to express the emotions of the comically taciturn would- be couple.  Among the treats is a Finnish version of Gordon Lightfoot's classic ""Early Morning Rain."" I love Aki Kaurismaki so I could be biased and guess what ... I loved the film. Classic Aki, if you are a fan you'll love it. Hilarious, unpredictable, deadpan. This is not an action film.  It is a beautifully rendered look at the mundane life of two characters we desperately hope will find each other.  And very subtly we see their characters change because, well, there now are reasons to change.  They embrace life very differently than before because of each other.  Beautiful film. ""Fallen Asleep"" would have been a better name for this one. Very slow paced. (And The NY Times review gave away anything that could have been mildly interesting.) Kaurismaki presents a succinct, drama-free depiction of the suffering, loneliness, alcoholism, and poverty of the Finnish working class. Static shots, laconic dialogue, chromatic expressiveness, and a marvelous selection of music from the 50s create the framework in which this love story unfolds, pierced by the news of the war in Ukraine, which, although synthetic and repetitive, nevertheless contains a rapturous emotionality. Fallen Leaves is perhaps Kaurismaki's toughest and shortest film, but also the most necessary in these times. Really enjoyable. A story about two people each living out their own rather bleak existence - but find hope and companionship with one another. The film is from Finland, so it has rather dark. sardonic humor and minimalist qualities. However, the actors are compelling to watch and the story is engaging. Lower class, industrial town with very few people to choose from to date, but a few middle aged couples do finally meet and match up.  Caim, gentle, uplifting, hopeful, and quiet film.  Few words, but much said. Not everyone lives on Park Avenue. For vierest new to Karausm√§√§ki Films this is a nice introduction. It doesn't add any new element to his previous films. (Variation of the usual story, greatly crafted pictures, desperate characters) However it's still a good one!"
Comedy,barbie,"For all the great things Robbie and Gosling are doing on a comedic level, their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature accepting another's lived experience and desires. Every choice here‚Äîevery line, every prop, every idea‚Äîis at once thoughtful and fun, for a moving meditation on womanhood delivered as a singular cinematic experience. Barbie isn't just about the doll. Barbie is an explosion of concepts made into a movie, which will make you change your perspective on life, yes, Barbie is a movie that changes lives, and that's what that's what cinema is for. {Full review in Spanish}

 A sassy comedy that raises questions for people of all ages about what it means to frame your life as a quest.
 Barbie is feminism 101, but for the global mainstream audience who have been served nothing but depoliticised superheroes for decades, the directness of Barbie's feminism is an essential step for reclaiming the soul of the Hollywood blockbuster.

 [Barbie] takes our complicated real-world relationship to Barbie and uses it as a metaphor to interrogate the impossibly high, often contradictory standards women are held to in our male-dominated culture. To watch Barbie is to feel totally and completely seen. And that's what makes Barbie worthy of the wait.  The laughs are plentiful and the set design is eye-popping, but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of numerous themes. Barbie boasts impressive production design, costumes, and a pair of leads up to the task of bringing their respective dolls to life, but sadly comes up a little short when it comes to its screenplay. The film‚Äôs boldness and, frankly, weirdness, allows Barbie to become a successful sum of its parts. It‚Äôs a film that clearly has something to say and doesn‚Äôt want audiences to get caught up in the fact that it‚Äôs a doll at the center of it. One of the best films of the year in cinematographic terms, probably the best comedy that we have seen in a long time, and an extraordinarily entertaining product that promotes the value of searching for a more cohesive society. [Full review in Spanish] Gerwig and Baumbach lure viewers with the promise of squeaky clean pop-culture fun, all while Trojan-horsing a stranger, more complex battle of the sexes. Barbie is a dazzling new instant classic and unlike anything you‚Äôve seen before. It‚Äôs the perfect summer movie and one of the funniest of the year. Though presented as a funny comedy about the doll that we all know, in reality, it is a very fine and brave portrait of what it means to be a man and a woman today. [Full review in Spanish] Early-on, ""Barbie‚Äù resembles those Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello beach party movies. It's breezily photographed in pop art colors by Rodrigo Prieto. In Barbieland, the houses don‚Äôt have walls and everybody seems happy. Mellow whimsy prevails. It explores the frailties of masculinity and the post-feminist struggle to escape the matrix of utopian feminism, even though Barbie and Ken's journey of self-discovery sometimes misses the point of fun. [Full review in Spanish] It's the rare film that's as intelligent as it is entertaining. ...[Greta] Gerwig‚Äôs pink, plastic epic is infused with its director‚Äôs indie spirit and far more cognizant of the toy‚Äôs complicated legacy than you might expect. The film gets a little lost at times, as if it had too many storylines to play with and won‚Äôt let any of them go... But there are many great jokes in the film. Greta Gerwig has created a coming-of-age feminist self-aware masterpiece in Barbie with a heart of gold that both subverts and matches expectations.","Movie was funny as ever, with a real message behind it which I was surprised about. Film qui n'a que pour seul but de montrer a quel point les hommes ne servent a rien.
Le g√©n√©rique de fin avec doja cat √©tait plus int√©ressant que le film. I tried, I really did. I couldn't get through it. The musical numbers are awful. I liked America's speech, but the rest of the movie is awful. Love Margot though Different, great, creative, and inspirational. I think the only way to condense an idea about this movie is with those words, and they still feel insufficient. Not good. Wanted to like it, just not good. Margot was good tho. Movie of the year in term of impact Movies have one job. Entertain you. Barbie was entertaining from start to finish. It also had something to say about society that was true. If this movie offends you, stop being butt hurt and do something else. ""I have all the genitals."" -Ken This movie is way overrated and everyone that says they like it is straight up lyingggg. This movie was so boring. I don‚Äôt know why people liked it so much, why this movie made so much money. Ambitious, charming and funny. While this movie had a subtle message, overall I thought it was without substance. Afterwards (for the first time in my life) I thought to myself, ""That was 2 hours of my life I will never get back!"".  I guess I just do NOT understand what all the hype is about. My adult daughter was with me and her review matched mine. It was 2 hours of cotton candy - all fluff and air. I was so excited to go see Oppenheimer... and really only bought tickets for Barbie as well because you know... the whole OppenBarbie thing.... OMG... so glad I did. Opp was a snooze fest... that's right, nudity, sex, the biggest bombs in history and so much TALKING.... drag tail out of there and into BARBIE... soothing, hilarious, joyful, multi-layered, heart touching, and kind of a musical... wait I was exhilarated by kind of a musical? YES. Oh youdangbetcha yes. So if you haven't seen it yet... you are so lucky! It's still in your future! Please, see Opp first... like a gin and tonic.... and then see Barbie... a delicious shroomy cherry fizz. üôÇ The storyline was very generic, and the movie wasn't funny to me, and I should at least laugh once in a comedy. The acting was really good though and I think the two leads did really well. But unfortunately the message of the movie was confusing and inconsistent. So I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Movie that made me thought about it for a long time. One of the worst movies I have seem. Seem like the creators of Barbie never filmed movie before and their first attempt is you would expect. I was surprised by the real life social lessons that the movie provides, and it is honestly a fun way to bring Barbie to the big screen without resulting in a tasteless comedy. The scenery and characterization were really on point, too. Just not what you would expect to see on a Barbie movie: it's better! Fun to watch but totally a mistake to cast Ryan Gosling as Ken. He looks more like a grandpa with his make up and face expression. He looks awkward in any of the scene he is in. Whereas Margot Robbie shines through every scene she is in. Both lack of the chemistry with each other. It is more like a grandpa with beautiful grand child. Meh, same old same old Boring, silly, It is a waste of time. No story. Fairly bad.  Stupid."
Comedy,the_persian_version,"Girls succeed, and fun remains the operating mood for The Persian Version movie. A vibrant comedy that perfectly balances the film‚Äôs dramatic overtone with continuous pockets of levity. It‚Äôs a story of determination and independence, filled with headstrong female characters overcoming misogynistic prejudice. It's also a lot of fun Though Leila is an engaging and sympathetic character, Shireen‚Äôs saga is the more engrossing as she ascends from child bride to enterprising businesswoman and champion to immigrants trying to achieve the American dream.  Once you get past the feeling of wanting more, The Persian Version is a heartwarming -- and often heartbreaking -- exploration of a mother and daughter repairing their future relationship by confronting their past. You can admire writer-director Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs   ambition, but the effect is like watching a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air at once. Filled with laughter, heart, and excellent work from Layla Mohammadi and Niousha Noor, The Persian Version is a delight to watch. ... recombines familiar themes into a fresh and vibrant package that manages a heartfelt mix of humor and sentiment. A filmmaker who has been around for more than a decade suddenly establishes herself as a bold new comic voice in The Persian Version. I‚Äôd welcome more of this (and some more filmmaking discipline) from her and her leading lady. Too many shifts in times, tones, and ideas crowd the earnest intentions. A comedy in bold, candied colors and spirited performances, Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs <I>The Persian Version</I> sings, zings and even stings with cultural specificity... Madcap dashes... rise above the potent danger for a descent into therapeutic digression.  One of the year‚Äôs most surprisingly potent small discoveries. Even though some of the characters are thinly developed, the film ends on a touching high note that helps to alleviate some of the overarching shortcomings. The result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals. [But,] while a good time was had, I can't shake the sense that there was potential for so much more. Though light-hearted, The Persian Version deals with serious issues pertaining to fragmented cultural identity and generational disconnection. Keshavarz hopscotches through numerous genres to relate this feisty feminist tale, and those tonal shifts can be jarring. But the payoff, including a couple of dance numbers, is worth enduring a few bumps in the road.  The Persian Version goes beyond its title to be a universal yet specific story for immigrants everywhere. You‚Äôll be equal parts laughing and crying throughout.

 Yet despite its flaws, The Persian Version is engaging and fresh. With Keshavarz at the helm, the movie is simultaneously familiar and unexpected, and its joyful approach will draw the audience into what may be an unfamiliar world for some.  The Persian Version remains an impassioned piece of work that sets Kezhavarz, Mohammadi, and Noor as ones to watch if you weren‚Äôt paying attention to their work before. ...a mostly interminable comedy that remains hopelessly unable to capture the viewer‚Äôs interest and attention (even fleetingly)... Maryam Keshavarz‚Äôs semi-autobiographical film paints a colorful portrait of an Iranian American family that crosses borders and timelines.","An interesting, complicated, and funny story of an immigrant family's generational struggle to leave Iran and make it in America told with a good soundtrack and the occasional dance scene. just an awesome movie ... What a great movie! I just finished it and honesty I'm so impressed by the original story of it. My Iranian heart can't be more emotional tonight. Shout out to all the casts amd whoever was involved in making this lovely piece of art. Absolutely hilarious. Loved it. At the beginning it seems a classical politically correct movie, but soon we discover a real life story who makes us laugh and cry in the same time. To movie is very good and the story too. Even the soundtrack makes a great job on it. I really enjoyed and all the characters (there are alot) are remarkable. Molto bello! Great directing, excellent acting and overall a perfect comedy yet a tear jerker. I am Persian and have lived most of my life in Iran. This movie doesn't come close to capturing the essence of Persian culture. The portrayal of life in Iran, both now and in the past, doesn't align with reality. The actors, their attire, the movie's settings, and the cultural references are far from accurate representations of Iran and Iranians. In terms of the film itself, there are numerous issues. For instance, Sheerin (the mom) undergoes drastic changes in skin color and eye color when depicted at a younger age, lacking any resemblance to her older self. Overall, this movie falls significantly below average. How refreshing to see a film by  Iranian-American Artists!!! I loved how the film spanned over three generations: from the small country village of the grandmother, to the American city of the newly arrived immigrant mother, and finally, the modern day American culture of the granddaughter.  The film hits hard at first with a look at the youngest of the three females, whose lifestyle is difficult for her mother to swallow.  Interestingly the grandmother, perhaps having grown more accepting and wiser over the years, has a closer connection to her granddaughter. As the story progresses, the youngest learns the background story of her mother, who it turns out,  is probably the biggest heroine of the three, despite her stoic demeanor.  The end of this movie had me in tears.  It was a wonderful, moving narrative about culture, realized and unrealized dreams, fortitude, family, judgement, and most importantly, LOVE. Very well put together lively entertaining and culturally informative. Would like to see more Iranian American films. 

I liked the actress who played the grandmother had me laughing hysterically! 

The American drag queen character played his part brilliantly!                                                

This a movie that I recommended to all my friends and family.

It is a movie for baby boomers, and millennials, and generation Z.

Every Iranian American will find something to relate to.

I sincerely hope that this is just a beginning of this talented Iranian writer's career.

I hope to see the Iranian director and writer produce more movies of this bicultural genre. Story was well written. Pacing was great and the film really kept me engaged to the screen. One of the best films Ive seen all year. Very amazing how the Persians are so similar to many immigrant success stories of different ethnicities. The way in which this movie moves through generations of women and balances trauma with comedy is absolutely incredible. You will laugh and cry and feel like you're with your family. Amazing to see Irooni representation like this. TRAILBLAZER! Abundantly bold and revolutionary in its storytelling! This film and its protagonist are what we need as a society to break out of the idea that immigrant stories need to be confined to the linear (and often lying) narrative of The American Dream. Leila, our hero, ceases to give up control by relentlessly championing her own story through writing herself into the narrative, front and center. We traverse through time with her as she makes real time discoveries of who she is, where she came from, and the power of her lineage. As a result, the storyline with her mother is written with an unflinching reverence and tenderness. This film will make you laugh, cry, and experience a rollercoaster of emotions as it shows you a pathway to healing and what it means for a family to break the cycles of intergenerational trauma. A film that we all need to see. I urge you to go see this film. I've been raving all weekend. The best film I've seen all year. I have never felt so seen, so moved, and so encaptured by a plot line and a cast. I cried tears of belonging and understanding. I softly hummed to the songs and dances of nostalgia. Maryam and her team so beautifully captured her family's story, and in doing so, illustrated the texture and depth of the Iranian and immigrant story in the US. The trailer only shows a sliver of the film -- there was so much depth and creativity in the storytelling. I don't want to reveal more, but go see The Persian Version, once with your girlfriends, once with your Iranian and non-Iranian partners, and once with your maman and mamanbozorg (half of the film is in Farsi). You'll get so much out of watching each time. I enjoyed the movie for highlighting the cultural differences between the US and Iran/ Persia. The movie was at once funny and serious, very moving. As an Iranian-American who grew up in the US, ""The Persian Version"" is a mirror reflecting the nuances of my own life.  Watching Leila's journey was like walking through my own memories. The film's portrayal of growing up in the US with Iranian roots resonated deeply with me, bringing forth emotions and memories I hadn't fully understood until now.

Leila's struggles, her efforts to balance her dual heritage, and her navigation through the complexities of family dynamics are not just cinematic elements; they are lived experiences for many, including myself. As the only queer daughter in my family, the film's exploration of patriarchy and familial expectations struck a particularly personal chord. It validated my experiences in ways that are hard to articulate.

The film is beautifully layered‚Äîfunny yet poignant, light-hearted yet deeply touching.  
It captures the vibrancy and beauty of Iranian culture, and the essence of being caught between two worlds. The stories of Leila's mother and grandmother were especially moving. They shed light on the resilience of our ancestors, making me realize how little we often know about their struggles. This realization fostered a newfound empathy for my forebears and a sense of pride in my heritage.

""The Persian Version"" is a film that has helped me piece together parts of my past, understand my history better, and feel less alone in my journey. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maryam Keshavarz for making a film that not only entertains but also heals and enlightens. It's a rare gem! We really enjoyed the story line and how it all came together at the end! The actress portraying Leila did an amazing job! Will definitely recommend it to friends! I laughed and cried in this movie!
Great story telling and funny characters. This movie innovates many artistic elements including concise subtitles, disarming humor in two languages, emotional depth, unexpected plot twists and cultural commentary. Anyone with an ethnic family can relate to this. It's like the modern My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Love Laylas spot on narration and take on modern day relationships versus traditional family traditions. One of the most delightful Persian movies I have seen so far. No matter what  the ethnicity or culture,  there is something in this movie for everyone. Excellent storytelling.!!"
Comedy,scrapper_2023,"Downbeat but uplifting. [Scrapper] finds some fascinating things to tell, and is charming in its form and conclusion, thus launching the career of a director who may have many more things to say. [Full review in Spanish] Charlotte Regan delves with delicacy and humor, without avoiding the dramatic aspects, into the clumsy but sincere relationship between a girl and her absent father... [Full review in Spanish] Amidst all the intentional artificiality of the filmmaking, [Campbell and Dickinson's] largely improvised interactions never ring false ‚Äî a dynamic that‚Äôs crucial to making the movie feel genuinely touching and real rather than saccharine and shallow.  There is community and light to spare for some new (and nice) angry young people. [Full review in Spanish] Scrapper is constantly animated by a spirit of fun, as if Regan and her team couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to dwell too long on the sad bits. Scrapper refuses to be pigeonholed as another dreary story about working-class life. Grief has hope, youth holds the keys to everything. Scrapper director Charlotte Regan, who hails from this working-class London milieu, effortlessly captures how the community wildly crisscrosses in the shared spaces around their pastel, candy-colored flats. Director Charlotte Regan handles these matters with a candy-colored levity that can quite often be charming, in a whimsical, Wes Anderson way, but sometimes just plain baffling. A really remarkable directorial debut. It's a quirky, weird, delightful and offbeat film.  Think of it as the bastard offspring of Charlotte Wells‚Äôs Aftersun and Sean Baker‚Äôs The Florida Project, with a little Wes Anderson thrown into the mix... Even as it heads exactly where you‚Äôre expecting, her simple story grows just as likable and touching as it intends. Scrapper has the charm to burst through the coldest of hearts and win you over with whimsy, bants and working class joy. A poignant tale of rediscovery. Dickinson & newcomer Campbell shine in this gritty, yet heartwarming father-daughter narrative. A testament to resilience, growth, and the ties that bind. Delicately dancing the knife edge between too-cute and over-maudlin, the filmmaker and her terrific actors have given viewers that rarity in cinema: uplift without the dreary moralizing.  There‚Äôs scarcely a scene you won‚Äôt see coming a mile away, but it‚Äôs comforting when formulas are handled with this kind of care. Lola Campbell just [gives] a great performance... she and Harris Dickinson have really fun chemistry. I love this movie so much. This is going to end up in my top 10 list at the end of the year. Scrapper, a slight but moving slice-of-life set in urban London, is anchored by the central performance of Lola Campbell as Georgie Campbell is a revelation. This is her first movie role, and her performance is flawless.","I'm not crying, you are....a wonderful movie. Basically its about grief and coping and growing up. But it's still positive and charming. Wonderful. It's a very interesting movie with good acting and storyline. It's definitely worth the watch. The movie becomes interesting when the father shows up. It is a little dull before that time, and glorifying child thief and bicycle thief is not funny either. Funny, endearing, authentic. Terribly sweet. Slow moving, but well worth the time spent. Touching story of a kid who loses her mom only to have a unexpected dad appear This movie was a wonderful surprise.  It was billed as a comedy ... I cried my eyes out. A beautifully told and shot movie about grief It's a wonderful movie.  The happy ending may not be realistic, but harsh reality is not for everyone. A very nice and heartfelt little film. I love the main two character dynamics and the consistent happy-sad tone between most of the conventions between the two and throughout the film. I also love all the little camera tricks and storytelling mechanics that help push this not all too interesting of a premise more entertaining. It's a really good little movie, go watch it if you can. Beautiful movie bound for cult classic, movie hipster's selection territory. The scene work is so thoughtful and precise for such a simply shot movie. Lola Campbell and Alin Uzun are both amazing, for any age and any experience level, but to do that in their first films- wow. Harris Dickinson is a rising star. Funny, emotional, and knows what it is trying to accomplish. Loved it. Some good moments but overall, disappointing. Rather obscure at times Scrapper, the film by British filmmaker Charlotte Regan, is a heartwarming creation. It tells the story of Georgie, a 12-year-old girl who finds herself living alone in London following her mother's passing. When her estranged father, Jason, unexpectedly reenters her life, Georgie initially resists his presence. However, as they reconnect and spend time together, a bond forms between them, and they learn to rely on one another.

Scrapper is visually stunning with its colourful aesthetics. Lola Campbell's portrayal of Georgie as she brings resilience and determination to the character makes her genuinely captivating. Harris Dickinson also shines as Jason ‚Äì a man striving to make amends for his mistakes.
The film strikes an uplifting tone while simultaneously exploring themes such as grief, loss, and abandonment. It delves into the significance of resilience, personal growth, and the importance of family ‚Äì all highly relevant in today's society and culture, where adaptation to challenges is crucial. Regan skillfully balances these elements throughout the film without it becoming overly burdensome or excessively sentimental.

Scrapper is a well-crafted and delightful movie. It tells a heartwarming tale of strength, personal development and the significance of loved ones. Great acting and characterisation, poignant, gentle, real, funny - moving carefully and in a measured way through today's life. Highly recommended. A film that could turn any gay person straight. If the set up for writer-director Charlotte Regan's unexpectedly charming debut feels very reminiscent of last year's Aftersun, another British debut feature about a relationship between a young father played by a hot up-and-coming British actor, in this case Harris Dickinson, and a young newcomer, Lola Campbell, who avoids preciousness by playing the 12-year-old as if she's possessed by a much older soul, the tone of the films cannot be more different. Seen entirely through the eyes of Campbell's Georgie living mostly alone in her council flat, except for the occasional company of her bestie/bicycle thief accomplice, Alin Uzun's Ali, she's spending her summer holidays working through the 5 stages of grief after her single mom passed away; that is until Dickinson's Jason, her young estranged father, suddenly appears (in a hilarious but telling entrance) upending Georgie's life and forcing her to confront the uncertain future ahead. Set mostly within a fading pastel-coloured council estate, the realism here is tinged with a sense of fantastical optimism; while the humour in seeing the film through those juvenile eyes is further padded out with comical cutaways and mockumentary style side-narrations that are irreverent but cute. The tone here is more a British Sean Baker than Ken Loach, with a big dollop of Bogdanovich's Paper Moon especially in the emotional tug-of-war between the father and daughter, turning initial suspicions into something more heartwarming. Dickinson is initially enigmatic and cagey, but ultimately goofily loveable while Campbell and Uzun are naturalistic, engaging and bursting with innocence and energy. The ending does skirt towards sentimentality and the simple but moving story itself maybe familiar, perhaps even slight, but it has genuine heart at its core and at barely 85mins, this is the definition of short and sweet and a promising career opener for Regan. Very strong acting performances from the leads. Refreshing - albeit light in story - film about a daughter reconnecting with her father.  Lots of heart and a few humorous moments throughout. Scrapper is a small gem of a film. The British are very adept at producing humanistic and realistic dramas and this fine film is no exception. But it's not at all gloomy. Even with a tough subject matter it has a light touch and frequent laughs. Georgie is a 12-year-old girl who lives in East London. Her mother has died but she somehow manages to survive on wits and sometimes stealing. She keeps the social workers at bay by pretending she lives with her uncle. Suddenly her estranged father, Jason, turns up after living in Spain for most of Georgie's life. The film then becomes a story of both Jason and Georgie coming to terms with other. There are ups and downs and regrets and recriminations. This film feels lived in and totally honest. Performances are fine. Lola Campbell is a real discovery and Harris Dickinson builds on his previous strong work. A film small in stature but very well made and constructed. A great film, with brilliant performances and fantastic moments. Charlotte Regan‚Äôs film is an exceptional coming of age story. Really heartwarming. The Georgie actress is nothing short of an amazing talent.  So, so good."
Comedy,waitress_the_musical,"Watch the film version of the musical, and you‚Äôll find out what baking can do. Baking up a storm of humor and heart, the pro-shot Broadway production with Bareilles leading the charge is the perfect treat this holiday season. While Waitress is still probably a dish best served live, like Hamilton and Come From Away, seeing this event presentation feels like a good idea. The show is smoothly staged before an appreciative audience, with well-chosen theatrical touches.  This is Bareilles‚Äôs show in every way. While she doesn‚Äôt quite match the emotional subtlety of Jessie Mueller, who originated Jenna, she has grown in leaps and bounds as an actress and provides a warm anchor for the movie. ...combines the feeling of being in a Broadway audience with the advantages of a filmed performance that is preserved for posterity and can be viewed without buying a plane ticket to New York. This sweet story lends itself nicely to a musical... A lovely tribute to Adrienne Shelly. Most of the songs Bareillis wrote are upbeat, which matches the tone of the original Adrienne Shelly movie starring Keri Russell. When the music slows down for ballads, they are emotional and powerful. The film accomplishes its principal goal of capturing Sara Bareilles‚Äôs spectacular take on Jenna Hunterson, especially in its close-ups of the singer-songwriter. Bareilles...is splendid here, especially when delivering her Act 2 tour de force, ""She Used to Be Mine."" Sure, the show can be super-sugary and sentimental, but I was sold. And now I am hungry for pie. But even if the musical‚Äôs attempt to give back to the medium that birthed the source material is uneven, it accomplishes its main important goal: It will help more people see this wonderful piece of musical theater.","just as good if not BETTER than the live performance. a rare treat, must see. I love when these opportunities are offered. When we can't travel to see shows, this is a great, reasonable option. Waitress The Musical was just right. I had only seen bits and pieces on YouTube and love ""She Used to be Mine."" That song is a 'belt it out in the car' song. The entire cast did an admirable job with their roles, but I specifically loved Christopher Fitzgerald and Drew Gehling and their dynamic. Well worth the money, and I would see it again. Sooooo good. 100 ü©∑‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöü©µüíôüíú I love when musical are direct from the stage. It's like seeing it on Broadway and a studio hasn't rewritten the show. Excellent show!!! Sara Bareilles is so talented. I would have loved if Jason Mraz played Dr. Jim Pomatter for the movie (He played him on Broadway for a limited time.) I saw this when it was on Broadway and this is actually better, you get every nuance and emotion from the actors. Sara Barielles not only wrote all the music, she can ACT and has such great comedic and dramatic abilities. Please go see it if it's playing in your city this week! One of the best filmed musicals I've ever seen.  The cinematography captures the feel of the stage, while still making the audience feel like they are present in the diner and also capturing effective closeups of solos during emotional scenes.  The on stage transitions between scenes is so well done with the fact that both the stage hands and even the orchestra/band are regular members that go to the Diner were a majority of the story takes place.  The musical performances and acting is phenomenal as well. Loved it on the big screen.  Loved the music and the acting was incredible. Loved this movie.   Very entertaining musically and with the story line.  Not for younger kids under 13. The cast was exceptional
Sara Bareillis was amazing - as a writer, singer, and actress
The staging and choreographer was so creative and entertaining
The direction of the filming was simply glorious
Am going again this week Very authentic and raw.  This was something special.  The raw emotion from Sara as Jenna was incredible. To die for movie of one of my favorite Broadway shows ever!!! The cast is magnificent, story line emotional with hysterically funny script and gorgeous music!!! 
Will purchase this when it becomes available - and super happy to see it repeatedly in theatre when it plays for more than it's five consecutive days.
MUST SEE!!! Fun, but not as impressive as Hamilton (for example). Super fun with great music! Great real life themes that remind you what being human is about. Choreography was a little cheesy, but the music is fantastic! LOVED!!! So funny, witty and heartwarming. Love this movie capture of an amazing Broadway show! Every time I watch a movie in theatres I spend way too much money and have the feeling of maybe I shouldve just watched it on streaming. But this time nothing can come close to seeing Sara Bareilles on the big screen with such a beautifully crafted story. Im thankful to had catch the movie on its last day of screening. What a joy! Check out this movie when it hits Apple TV! This film is breathtaking, and a must see. Every performance is show stopping. I've seen the live play twice, including the original Broadway cast, but this was a whole new experience.  Absolutely magical - stellar cast - and Sara's amazing g voice. See it! Incredible performances and story unfolded beautifully! Masterpiece!!!"
Comedy,chicken_run_dawn_of_the_nugget,"Aardman's capably common use of Rube Goldberg-like contraptions in plot pursuits, and another neat escapist Harry Gregson-Williams score help all the chicken feed go down quite easily, too.  ‚Ä¶bright enough for undemanding kids, and should keep the brand in the public eye, but the four quadrant appeal of Aardman‚Äôs beloved best work has gone the way of the Dodo on this evidence‚Ä¶ [I]t‚Äôs fun while it lasts with excellent visual details that seamlessly combine with stop-motion animation and CGI. It has its heart in the right place... [Full Review in Spanish] Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is not as edgy as the original, but the animated sequel is still as effective, offering another dose of entertainment.

 Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is baggier than the original, not as funny, and it drags in parts and is on the whole less memorable. But dammit, it‚Äôs still fun, and that‚Äôs ultimately what matters. Such is the standard of Aardman that even though Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget might be considered heads and tail feathers above some other animated films, it doesn‚Äôt compare favorably to the studio‚Äôs best work. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget isn‚Äôt as delightful as it should be. But it‚Äôs still fun, and absolutely fun enough for family movie night. If only the movie lived up to its witty title, in a Netflix film that‚Äôs mildly and sporadically amusing but mostly just an unnecessary, warmed-over rehash. The spirit and talent of Aardman Animation is all still present in this high energy romp ... it's kinda a nod at Die Hard while spinning the unique stop action animation in many hilarious ways. Can we remember the chickens and the egss of 23 years ago?  This new Chicken Run effort is another delightful stop-motion delight from the legendary Aardman studio. [The film] may not reach the heights of its predecessor, but it does contain enough good stuff to fill up a few hours. Despite twenty-three years between the first film and this sequel, the story feels as fresh and connected as it did back then. I hope we see more of these characters in years to come. The film makes so many callbacks and hat tips to ‚ÄúChicken Run‚Äù that it feels less like a sequel and more like an inferior remake. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is fantastic in every way. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs hilarious, and it‚Äôs filled with so much heart. Nostalgiac but never old, new but never detached from its roots, the film is one of the best animated features of the year.

 A sweet storyline about parenthood, a spunky new heroine, and the return of a terrifying villain help make Dawn of the Nugget a clucking good time. Fans of the first Chicken Run film will delight in the nostalgia with a new installment that features the same beloved characters, a fearsome foe and another mission worth crowing over. It was a hardly a necessary sequel to what was a pretty terrific original, but it does no harm to the initial premise and has enough clever new ideas to hold our interest. Consistently entertaining in its comic mayhem.  It‚Äôs all very silly and lacks the wit of some of Aardman‚Äôs other movies, but it‚Äôs adequate fast-food entertainment for the kids.","¬°Wow! sin duda una de las mejores peliculas animadas del 2023, solo me hace falta ver Patos de Illumination y Trolls 3 de Dreamworks. Chickens purr just as an FYI. Not as good as the first one but an enjoyable watch regardless. Hopefully people will see this and realise that chickens are beautiful sentient animals who deserve life not to die in pain and fear for a nugget. If you empathise with and route for the chickens surely you can see that billions being killed every year for human greed is wrong and needless. 90%+ of meat in the UK and USA comes from factory farms. Animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change and deforestation. If you're watching this with your kids your diet choices affect the world they'll grow up in. Expecting abit more from this movie. Wasted 1hr40mins watching it. Absolutely gutted. It's a big no no from me A great stop-motion animation venture with the signature British humor from Aardman that I love so much. Bella Ramsey is great, and this is really just fun and enjoyable. Chicken Run Dawn of The Nugget One Minute Review  
https://youtube.com/shorts/8niyphYDAaU?feature=share It's a nice sequel to Aardman's first feature film. It doesn't really act like a nostalgia-fest but more like a sharp look at what happened next. It's definitely not perfect, with some noticeable flaws and I was kind of missing the darker edge the first movie had which made Tweedy and her farm a little more scary. And‚Ä¶why did they made Rocky so dumb? Anyway, a nice sequel and a nice look at how Aardman is doing. I just watched this movie yesterday and it was a great movie and really nostalgic and funny and fun. Great voice acting. I was 5 years old when the first one came out in 2000's. I'm 28 years old now and I still love the franchise. This film may not have us crowing as much in praise as the original film did, yet it is a well done sequel, allowing us to see how life now fares for Ginger, Rocky, their new daughter and their companions. However, there are some great benefits to seeing this sequel. Within the film there is the visually spectacular stop motion that Aardman is now known for, great characters including the new ones such as Molly, Frizzle or Dr. Fry and a captivating story. The story is notable in that it does have its dark moments, the title is ""dawn of the nugget"" of course, yet these moments are correctly balanced with the other humor, action and character development within the story. This film is an enjoyable ride for fans of the original and new moviegoers alike. It Was a Cool Movie But hope We Get To See Chicken Run 3 23 a√±os despu√©s del gran salto de Aardman a la gran pantalla, Chicken Run regresa en una secuela que lleva a la historia de las gallinas a otro nivel. La producci√≥n de esta pel√≠cula es mucho m√°s meticulosa y grande que la anterior. Los personajes ahora encaran algo mucho m√°s grande que la producci√≥n tardo mucho tiempo en construir. Empieza cuando parece que todo hab√≠a terminado en el final de la pel√≠cula anterior. Rocky y Ginger ahora son padres, pero queda claro que Ginger a√∫n sigue afectada por los eventos de la pel√≠cula anterior al punto de no dejar que la joven Mollie explore el mundo exterior. Mientras la pel√≠cula respeta la personalidad de los personajes, la joven Mollie es una mezcla de las personalidades de sus padres. Ella tiene la actitud de Rocky y el esp√≠ritu de Ginger. Bella Ramsey le da a Mollie un aire casi parecido al de Ellie en The Last of Us. Lo que desata los eventos de la historia se pueden sentir como si fuera culpa de Mollie, pero esta es una de esas historias donde las acciones de los padres tambi√©n son parte del factor que desata los sucesos. El deseo de Ginger por proteger a Mollie es noble, pero ocultar la verdad a veces no es la manera adecuada de proteger a los m√°s j√≥venes. El ambiente de la pel√≠cula es m√°s tecnol√≥gico y hay momentos que recuerdan a Misi√≥n Imposible. Hay m√°s orientaci√≥n hacia el humor o no tiene esa alegor√≠a social que ten√≠a la pel√≠cula anterior, pero sigue intacto el concepto de las gallinas queriendo enfrentarse a la cadena alimenticia porque sienten que ser alimento para los humanos es un acto de opresi√≥n contra ella. De principio a fin, se da la idea de que las gallinas se vuelvan una resistencia o grupo rebelde, dando un gui√±o a esa alegor√≠a social que tiene la pel√≠cula original. Dawn Of The Nugget es una aceptable secuela que expande esta historia, por m√°s que pareciera que la conclusi√≥n de la primera pel√≠cula fue definitiva. Es claro que a veces existe algo m√°s despu√©s del ""Felices para siempre"" y que no siempre son la conclusi√≥n definitiva. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 9/10. Dios, muy buena pens√© que me iba a decepcionar, pero, me encanto la historia es muy bonita, me gusto que otra vez saliera la mala. Not as good as the original of course but worthy nonetheless. I‚Äôd recommend it Great sequel to a classic. An entertaining and well-polished film that does manage to have some genuinely frightening scenes thrown into the mix, even if it's toned down from the first film by a mile and feels strangely alien compared to the first. A worthy sequel to the original. Great slapstick and claymation. 8/10 Wow Qu√© buena pel√≠culaü§©ü§© The Upsides Are:
1. Classic Villain Motive
2. Fun To Watch If You Want To Shutdown Your Brain For 1: 41: 39
3. Humor
The Downsides Are:
1. Doesn't Make Sence On [Spoiler Alert] That The Villain Survived Being Crushed By A Door In The First Movie

5 Stars Not as good as the original. However was a fun film that is definitely worth a watch. It does drag on at various points but it's an easy watch and is good fun! It felt enough like the original with its own spin, they did a great job. Never doubt Aardman with their charming claymation, funny writing, and swift direction!

Paranorman director Sam Fell's claymation adventure comedy Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023) is a very strong sequel to the legendary Aardman claymation picture Chicken Run (2000). Fell's direction is really touching and classy with a swift pacing and certainty of spirit. With a wonderful message of the importance of being brave and never being apathetic to what's wrong in the world, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget feels confident and meaningful. Aardman's claymation is as clean, fluid, cute, colorful, charming, and impressive as ever.

Writers Karey Kirkpatrick, John O'Farrell, and Rachel Tunnard continue the tale of chickens from Chicken Run's writers Nick Park and Peter Lord. It feels funny, family friendly, and inventive with warm characters and a familiar love of freedom. Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget criticizes deforestation, industrialization, capitalism, cowardice, factory farming, and cruelty towards animals with strong writing aimed at awful humans. Dawn of the Nugget is as sincere and thoughtful as Okja or Chicken Run.

Editors Sim Evan-Jones and Stephen Perkins use surprisingly quick cuts to keep an alarmingly fast pace for 97 brief minutes. Cinematographer Charles Copping shots with playful angles, moody lighting, and smoothly panning and tracking camera movements. Production designer Phil Lewis makes a quaint chicken paradise set that looks like The Shire from The Lord of the Rings and a colorful oppressive factory farm. The pink sets are as cute as Barbie. Art directors Richard Edmunds and Matt Perry have a vibrant style and stylish designs. Composer Harry Gregson-Williams hilariously sends up the Mission: Impossible theme for the infiltration sequence among other wonderfully sweet and playful music cues.

Thandiwe Newton is wonderful and inspiring as the brave British chicken heroine Ginger. Zachary Levi does an apt Mel Gibson impression as the flying circus rooster Rocky, now a father alongside Ginger's worried mother. Bella Ramsey is funny and curious as the free spirited child chicken Molly. Imelda Staunton is funny as the stout cynical chicken Bunty. Lynn Ferguson sounds smart as Scottish chicken inventor Mac. David Bradley is hilarious as the easily distracted elderly rooster Fowler.

Jane Horrocks steals the show again with her hysterical line delivery as the airhead chicken Babs. Romesh Ranganathan is great as the pessimist rat Nick like Daniel Mays' crafty rat Fetcher. Josie Sedgwick-Davies is a neat addition as the bubbly Frizzle. I liked Nick Mohammed's evil and deranged Dr. Fry. Miranda Richardson reprises her villainess Mrs. Tweedy with her killer ruthlessness.

How is Dawn of the Nugget so good? Always trust in Aardman."
