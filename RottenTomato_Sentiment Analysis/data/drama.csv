Drama,four_daughters_2023,"In telling the story of Olfa and her daughters, Ben Hania is also telling the tumultuous story of Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring, a promising movement that began in that country before spreading to the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania (The Man Who Sold His Skin) has fashioned a narrative-docu mix that’s highly ambitious and quite engrossing...There is a lot going on in this quasi-experimental film. And I was always enthralled.  Only with [this experience and] knowledge, as well as the tools to make it work for them, can women Eya and Tayssir's age attempt to finally break the cycle of exploitation and persecution into which they were born. I love this movie, and it might land on my Top Ten list at the end of the year. It is just extraordinary.  A masterful hybrid documentary about sisterhood, motherhood, rebellion, memory, and the agony that thrives with inherited trauma.  The more avant-garde it becomes, the more interesting Four Daughters is. This intriguing documentary mixes fact, recreation of events and family therapy in the story of a Tunisian mother who lost two of her children to jihadists. Arab voices in Western cinemas are all too rare, and “Four Daughters” is one of the best films of the year... Four Daughters is riveting in large part because the charismatic Olfa galvanizes attention. Her dynamism cannot be obscured beneath a funereal head covering.  As the actresses help recreate the life the family had, it turns into a sobering look at parenting, siblinghood, and ingrained patriarchy. Extremely powerful. This is a heartbreaker about mothers and daughters, the cruelty of repression and the slippery but revealing nature of performance. Four Daughters is unlike any film that I’ve seen, documentary or otherwise. Not only has Kaouther Ben Hania crafted an unforgettable work of art with Four Daughters, but she may have also invented a new genre of film. It delves deep into the nature of family bonding and the trauma of separation with an unfailing insight and empathy. [Four Daughers] doesn’t reveal the truth by blurring reality and fiction. Instead, Ben Hania’s film... pieces together memories and emphasizes (rather than minimizes) the effort it takes to reconstruct them. Ben Hania leaves us with much to digest in a film full of heartbreak and joy -- all set against a backdrop of Tunisian political turmoil that led to a rise in religious fervor. ""Four Daughters” is a triumph of layered storytelling. While it starts awkwardly, the audacious concept develops emotional depth as a portrait of hope and healing amid heartbreak. Engrossing, intimate, and expansive. The best part of it all is that Ben Hania manages to fill her fraught docu-drama with as much humor as sorrow, reminding us that even in the midst of tragedy there is always room to remember the joys that make life worth living. Cry, laugh, and learn.","The most compelling documentary of 2023. Stunning filmmaking which brings nuance and personal insights into the dynamics of a single Tunisian mother raising four daughters, two whom go missing. Ce film est absolument brillant. Tant dans la forme que dans le fond. Une réalisation inspirate. Et un témoignage sans égal de la situation des femmes musulmanes en Tunisie. J'ai pleuré, souris, ris. Une chose est sûre, ces femmes sont magnifiques tant elles nous ouvrent les portes de leurs vies.."
Drama,the_taste_of_things,"Although its delectable dishes provide a feast for the eyes — but unfortunately not the stomach — this French period romance is equally nourishing for the brain. ""The Taste of Things"" is about the ""how,"" not the ""what"". You get to know people best by understanding what obsesses them, the activities that interest them. I would be very interested if there might be a “director’s cut” version of the movie that the studio and Mr. Tran considered releasing or seeing the home video release of the film which might include “deleted” or “alternative scene” options. Lingering on the tongue like a sip of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the film leaves one feeling a little drunk, desperately hungry and entirely alive. The dishes are extraordinary, lit like they’re the prized sculptures at a museum, and constantly compounding and complicating themselves. It's a simple but richly observed film in the way these two characters, as well as their understated relationship, come to life by way of the little things.  An engrossing and mesmerizing delight that will nourish your heart, mind and soul. Perhaps one of the most viscerally indulgent films of the year, 'The Taste of Things' is a transfixing culinary triumph. The Taste of Things eloquently speaks the language of love through the art of cooking, and as a viewer, one can't help but be swept away by the warmth of its storytelling The Taste of Things is a stunning ode to food and the people who share it with one another. It’s as beautiful a depiction of the art of cooking as it is of love between its two cooks.

 Juliette Binoche...is simply magical and deserves Oscar consideration...There’s a joy in the love these characters have for food and for each other that washes over you.  THE TASTE OF THINGS is an intimate, exquisite experience. There is no denying that in Hung’s hands food is art. THE TASTE OF THINGS is a movie that begs to be seen a second time because of its intense beauty. And one does not have to possess a high interest in cooking to savor what happens in their kitchen. The film views the love of food and romance as all one singular desire for everything beautiful and fleeting in life. The chemistry between Binoche and Magimel is palpable and sensual, the cinematography is naturalistic, and of course, the film presents us with a series of dishes in the most appetizing and visually attractive way possible. Full review in Spanish. Class, Cuisine And Labor As Aphrodisiac. And the best foreign film this year. While surely a reflection of Hung's life experience - returning to his native Vietnam as an adult to decipher the mystery in film of radical transformation there to socialism. If the prawn scene in I Am Love gave you an orgasm, then The Taste of Things will make your heart, belly, and genitals explode. The Taste of Things is ultimately a fantasy world of abundance: but it is delicious filmmaking with a winning recipe of the act of sharing cultivated and embodied life with all its sweet and bitter flavours. The ex-couple sparkle when on screen together, and the years of intimacy with ups and downs between the two characters they play are instantly believable. Their shared love for food and friendship for each other feel real.  The Taste of Things is a genuinely thrilling love story, served alongside the heartbreak of realizing that time has passed as one kneads their life into a new and unfamiliar shape.","あかあかあかあかあかあかあかあかあかあか This movie is both complex and simple, like a Norwegian omelette. Silences and cooking noises are part of this symphony. I did not watch only this move, I savoured it and felt good about it like after an excellent dinner.  Reminded me of le festin de Babette. Stunning visuals - never seen a movie when food becomes a parallel sensual experience as the love story of the key characters. Pinochet, Magimel and the celebration of food are a much needed hymn to humanity in these dark times. Serenade of culinary scene filled with bountiful stories of romance and a side of gastronomy aspects. With mesmerizing detail of unique cuisine and it's background added more color to the movie. Eugiene and Dodin's relationship also portrays a beautiful poetry of their dynamic-duo translated as the culinary artist that complement each other."
Drama,killers_of_the_flower_moon,"The development of the characters, the performances, the cinematography, and the costume design make this film a true masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish] A depressing cinematic experience that never loses focus despite the long run time. [Full review in Spanish] Scorsese has made a somber, poetic adaptation of David Grann’s account of how a group of greedy white men systematically murdered members of the Osage Nation in early 1920s Oklahoma. Killers of the Flower Moon is the work of a wily old veteran who’s still restlessly searching for new ways to tell stories... and the result is devastating, provocative and profoundly sad, one part emotional gut-punch and one part intellectual argument.  In Martin Scorcese’s telling of the Osage Indian murders, all the violent contradictions of history unfold in domestic intimacy. While Killers of the Flower Moon covers familiar territory for Scorsese, he cedes the floor to the righteous fury of the Osage and other indigenous folks.  It features a fascinating fact-based story, some brilliantly filmed set pieces, and a great ensemble cast with some of America’s finest actors. A largely compelling and engaging cinematic experience Killers rises toward genre horror, and the horror comes from the intimacy of the violence being committed against the Osage... Who is Ernest, really, but a much dimmer, more passive Henry Hill? The subject may seem well-worn—a true-life story of a murder spree—but Scorsese elevates it into a meditation on love, guilt, and what it means to be righteous. Killers of the Flower Moon is as searing an epic as Martin Scorsese has made in his career, and if we don’t take this ending very seriously, we’re going to lose the medium. A killer of historical truth as well. With a seeming connection dropped from the title, 'The Birth Of The FBI' - and the US continuing that not unrelated pseudo-messianic urge, millions in the world slaughtered in that deplorable bid to 'save democracy.' Scorsese’s key interest in this narrative is the criminal machinations of the plot, which is no surprise given his career has almost exclusively been that type of film..Molly is a support character in what should be her story. A love story set amidst a series of murders revealing how indigenous people have been victims of the shadow side of American society -- racism and white supremacy.
 It's not as flashy as some of Scorsese's other films, with fewer expansive set pieces than we often see, but it has a soulfulness and quiet power that makes it one of his very best. Killers of the Flower Moon is a strong historical retelling of an abominable series of killings. But it suffers for straddling the line between an American biopic and a Scorsese gangster film. Proving his distaste for comic book popcorn movies, director Martin Scorsese delivers significant cinema with his take on Killers of the Flower Moon. A masterfully staged fresco darkly hued by cynicism, avidity, and transgression. DiCaprio and De Niro carry the film through their impersonations of what they are not, their acting of an act, so to speak: the nice, if rough-edged guy, and the genial businessman, the toast of the town.","Another Masterpiece by Martin Martin sent it out the park again A bit over-long, but one could argue it appropriate. This is t winning DiCaprio any Oscar's, but still a top shelf performance by him, as well as DeNiro. Beautifully shot. There is only one criticism and I will start off at that: I am a person that likes to go for late movies. This is certainly a movie I do not recommend, hence the downgrade in review. Although the detail in movie was great, I would not be surprised if this competed for an Oscars based on the nature of the movie. The movie storyline itself had its uniqueness as I was more informed about the Osage history as well as the abuse their society used to receive. Nevertheless, just because the details and the acting was great, need to consider runtime because this was way too long. The story and the characters develop with tact and credibility in Martin Scorsese's latest film, which reunites the master director with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio. It's newcomer Lily Gladstone, however, who steals the spotlight in every scene she's on screen. There's no denying that Killers of the Flower Moon tells a poignant story. Unfortunately, it's written without suspense, intrigue, or mystery, leaving viewers painfully aware of where the plot is going and how the events will eventually unfold. The mediocre dialogue and unnecessarily hefty runtime do the movie no favors, either. There was no legitimate reason for the film to be 3 hours long, so it ended up tedious and drawn out. Nevertheless, it made for a captivating experience to watch a well-made motion picture with stunning set pieces, costumes, and cinematography. Despite the movie's length, I felt interested the whole time. That's a testament to its pacing and compelling story. On top of that, you have tremendous performances by the entire cast...not a single bad performance. I felt as though DeNiro stood out in particular. 

Set peices were stunning...cinematography was stunning. Certainly a 5/5 experience. Took 4 hours to tell a story that should have taken 90 minutes. As tragic as the history is, the retelling was downright boring. Story of Native American tribe who's people are rich from oil & the people who marry & kill them to profit from their inheritance.
DeNiro & DiCaprio both delivery a great performance about love, greed, family.DeNiro may be type cast in roles where he is a greedy criminal out to make a profit for himself, but he plays each role so well it doesn't matter. The shocking true story of love, betrayal, murder, and a conspiracy to kill an entire native american people for their oil wealth. This is not a short film, but I appreciate Martin Scorsese's commitment to realism and the strong acting. Killers of the Flower Moon is TERRIBLE. I do not understand all these rave reviews. A long, boring, disjointed mess with the DUMBEST ending ever. The ending was SO VERY STUPID. The script was awful and DeNiro's character was just a different version of his Goodfellas character.  You could tell when Scorsese was trying so be just SO cinematic with some shots just to try to force emotion, which never worked. It was terrible and anyone who calls it a ""masterpiece"" is simply wrong. Acting, cinematography and wardrobe are exceptional.  Pacing is abysmally slow which renders the film unwatchable for me.  I am going to read the book instead, since it won't take as much of my time and will be more enjoyable.  The editing in for this film is horrendous. A historical movie about scandalous crimes on the Osage that is a reflection of what the US was and is. Today. Money is all America cares and this movie brilliantly portrays it. Absolutely brilliant film! I was completely captivated throughout the entire film. Not since Schindler's List has there been such an important film. The cast, script, cinematography, set design, soundtrack etc. is superb. Stellar performances with everyone involved giving 100%. And don't worry, it doesn't feel too long at all, it's just right. Never a wasted or dull moment. It's a haunting masterpiece that should not be missed. so slow and the plot is terrible. I agree the acting is fine and the directing is good just hated the story. Good story, good acting, but too long and too transparent. herein is over 3 hours of my journey... somewhat ironically, it definitely presents the challenging journey of others, in nearly slow motion... this likely will feel particularly uncomfortable. i respectfully watched everything produced, in its entirety. please find your own opinion. if you're still reading this you might agree to the failure of editing. assuredly, make certain you have have caffeine or alternative, as this feature could induce dozing. An instant classic. Scorsese perfected the movie formula a while ago and this is just another incredible example. If you are up for some slow pace but good performance from the leads its the movie for you. Scorsese missed so many important facts for this story.  Location of the Osage Agency, the BIA offices, plus the courthouse were ALL in Pawhuska, not Fairfax.     These locations are the actual places of several events.    Not including the murders in Fairfax.    
Birth of the FBI ??  Outright lie Scorsese!
Teddy Roosevelt established the FBI  in 1908.   Look it up.    Also the Million Dollar Elm- That's where millions in lease deals were made.   Again in Pawhuska. 

I know.  I grew up there. Being of a true event, greed and oppression overshadowing the root of humanity love highlighted the sad reality of life. The movies transparency is much needed."
Drama,our_son,"The slick results will resonate for some, but they felt artificial to me. As a director, Bill Oliver never allows this to be overly melodramatic with blow out, rage fueled fights. Luke Evans and Billy Porter are keen to keep everything as grounded as possible...both give terrific performances. The performances are excellent and despite some moderate contrivances, the compassion for kids and adults alike involved feels more heartfelt than forced. Our Son is a heartfelt drama with strong acting at its core from Luke Evans and Billy Porter. A simple yet engaging melodrama... This is a universal story, made more universal when seen from a different angle. “Sweet” and “sensitive” may win the day. But this fight over “Our Son” is a little bland and predigested A beautifully judged human drama that dissects a dying marriage with humor and intelligence, drawing out an especially open and moving performance from Porter. There’s plenty of lovely little moments here. And while Oliver and Peter Nickowitz’s screenplay plays a tad derivative in places, performances are top-notch.  Nothing gels until the 45-minute mark. That’s when the reality of divorce, separating and child custody issue sinks in... Anger, bitterness, sorrow and longing ensue, and the film finds its footing. A cathartically devastating film, Our Son reaches deep into the wells of emotion, delivering a well-constructed breakdown of love on the shoulders of two actors at the top of their game.  Our Son might get some comparisons to Kramer vs. Kramer because of the many similarities, but Our Son is more like a made-for-TV movie instead of an Oscar-worthy film. The convincing performances elevate this formulaic divorce drama when the pacing drags. Our Son is anchored by two incredibly powerful and heartbreaking performances by Evans and Porter.  “Our Son” deserves to open as many doors for Evans as it does for the character he plays. In Our Son, Luke Evans and Billy Porter deliver stunning performances, but it’s a familiar story we’ve all seen before.

 Porter, in a departure from what we've previously seen him do, unearths the complexities of a rather enigmatic character. Evans is masterful here in a revelatory performance  There’s too little here to distinguish the film from endless other broken-family dramas that have gone before. A universally emotional, deeply personal and wonderfully judged drama that dissects a broken relationship with equal layers of wit and wisdom. Our Son is a reminder that no matter what happens between parents, their children are still important. Our Son features a missed connection, with Evans and Porter struggling to deliver a believable relationship. Without this clicking into place, the rest of the story struggles to maximize its potential.","My favorite movie of 2023, hands down! This is an extremely well done film. I laughed and I cried. Beautiful story about navigating relationships through divorce. You must see it! An epic emotional journey with a stellar cast. Porter and Evans' on-screen chemistry is undeniable. A very humanizing perspective of a non-heteronormative relationship and family. Plus, an original song performed by Porter and Evans. See this film. Wonderfully frank and unaffected. Excellent performances and direction. Highly recommend LOVE this film. Not only does it have an incredible and talented cast and crew, but the screenplay (Peter Nickowitz and Bill Oliver) is incredibly meaningful and thought provoking. I wasn't expecting the film to be comedic, but there were quite a lot of moment that made me laugh. It's a must see! Our Son is a WONDERFUL movie. It's heartwarming. Funny, sad. Very relatable. A movie that NEEDED to be made. You HAVE to see it!!! Very well written & the all star cast is outstanding!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Beautiful story about the agony of divorce. ‘Our Son' reminds us that ""love is love is love""- and divorce is divorce, regardless of the sexual orientation of the spouses. Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. You will not regret watching this. It's soooo good. I am heterosexual and enjoyed the film.  It speaks to those who have been in a relationship of any kind.  Watch and enjoy. A beautiful film that resonates across the board. It is about parenting and relationships but mostly it is about hope and forgiveness.  A must see! Exceptional work from Bill and crew! Bravoooooooo. This is such a powerful and important movie. But it also has a great sense of humor. It is wrenching because you can see both sides and everyone is aware of the pain this could cause this child. But this is part of life and part of relationships. Actors are really engaging and funny. Billy Porter is awesome. This is the kind of movie that stays with you. Big recommend. The cast is terrific, delivery is spacious, a succinct, intimate and elegant drama. It's a queer love story that moves beyond adolescent yearning towards complexities of family, domesticity, aging, parenting, sacrifice, money … still seasoned with humor and hot dashes of adolescent yearning among adults. Glad I watched it. Intense, emotional, beautifully shot. Both leads are outstanding. I was looking for a good-cry and this movie delivered and then some. so emotional! Totally hot cast! Really heartwarming story and lovely acting. A deeply moving film with excellent performances from the entire ensemble. Highly recommend. Divorce flicks are not my thing but this movie hooked me from the getgo — and it hasn't yet let go. Inspired acting by Billy Porter, Luke Evans first and foremost but a fantastic ensemble cast and that enchanting boy managed to separate me from my beloved popcorn for nearly 2 hours. A beautiful story with fantastic performances from Billy Porter and Luke Evans. Loved it. This movie grabbed me and didn't let go. I felt so deeply for the characters in the film, their story is so beautifully portrayed by Evans and Porter. I highly recommend it but come prepared with some Kleenex--you will need them!"
Drama,priscilla,"Of all the directors working today, there is no one better suited than Sofia Coppola to make a movie about Priscilla's life with Elvis. Priscilla adds to the distinctive points of view on historical events from a female perspective and, through it, establishes a reflective look at the place of women in society. [Full review in Spanish] So finely attuned to the emotional swell of new relationship infatuation that you can almost hear the water as the wave of excitement recedes and reality sets in. Keeps the myth alive of a virgin and a hillbilly. Coppola has no insight. Maybe it was just a paid gig. It has no director’s vision, point of view, or interpretation. It’s a bore. The genius of Coppola’s film is that it is both knowingly hollow and somehow deeply felt all at once, celebrating female self-ownership and the travails of learning to know oneself. Pretty, muted and, in the end, boring. Priscilla will hold few surprises for Presley-holics. What the film does offer is a dreamlike take on a teenage girl swept off her feet by the Earth’s most famous man. Cailee Spaeny's portrayal of the eponymous character stands out as a career-defining performance, showcasing her remarkable talent and paving the way for a promising future in the industry. While it ultimately feels a bit hollow in what emotions it elicits, Priscilla has an unshakeable immersive quality that still conveys a sentimentality and lovesickness... Priscilla may not work for die-hard Elvis fans, but Coppola applies her visually appealing aesthetic to tell Priscilla’s story regardless of how Elvis is portrayed. This movie drifted away from me. It's more of an aesthetic object than a real biopic.  Who was Priscilla, really, other than a girl obsessed with a larger-than-life star? After 110 minutes of this movie, I'm still not sure, and even though that’s kind of the point, it makes the character portrayal seem like it’s missing something. Sofia Coppola was the perfect person to study Priscilla Presley because she understands how to bring forth the ornate and instantly undercut it with the way she frames it. The story has the impact of a slowly deflating balloon, and it’s almost funny how anticlimactic the ending is. ... This might be intentional – endings in real life can be like that. It doesn’t make the film any better. I think Coppola does well balancing that duality, never shying from the violence or the romance. If anything, she employs that convergence to deliver a compelling biopic that seeks to dismantle the illusion by recreating its inescapable allure. It's a sad story of isolation and control. Although it has a few issues here and there, this is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates thoughtful and visually stunning cinema. A star-making role for Cailee Spaeny, and I appreciated Sofia Coppola and Priscilla Presley addressing the elephant-in-the-Elvis-room—what is it about rock stars and 14-year-olds? The star of this movie is Cailee Spaeny who has all the best lines and scenes. Priscilla is played as a victim, and it shows how she became famous. Unfortunately, it omits the most interesting part of her life, which happens she divorces Elvis. Exquisitely controlled and beautiful, this (kind of) true story is also somewhat muffled, flat and anti-climactic. This feels like a deliberate choice by filmmaker Sofia Coppola, however, who adapted the script from Priscilla Presley’s autobiography.","This filme is a masterpiece on its own. Sophia knows how to use her gifts as a director, and always give us so much depht, and yet a fresh run. I felt anger, love and care for this girl in a way that only a work of her could give. Amazing! This was so s l o w!  I could barely see the picture or understand what Elvis was saying so I put subtitles on!  The acting was really good.  It's  too bad the script wasn't! Sofia Coppola is obviously a great for a reason, throughout Elordi’s Elvis’ mumbling which sounds true to form, there was a deeper story of Priscilla and Spaeny’s Priscilla that hit home. The movie and the perfomance made me remember what feelings were like when I was 14/15 years old and throughout my early 20s and they were communicated beautifully, raw and complete within the scope of the film. The darker shades of Elvis were highlighted here and the fact that Elordi looks less like Elvis works in his favor and the audiences favor to forget the megastar that Elvis was and still is. He dolled Priscilla up, and took away her individuality because he thought he knew better what looked good on her, he was very caught up in the imagery of things, and he emotional turmoiled Priscilla, the translation of all of that on film is worth watching. The music choices in the film are actually perfect, and so is Dolly Parton’s I will always love you at the end for many reasons. Never knew Priscilla was perfect and Elvis was a demon. No Elvis music, no story, no laughs, no fun.  Brilliant idea.  Every other clip of a scene is Elvis suggesting something and Priscilla whispering.   I guess she was shocked that when you move in with the most famous man in the world he's going to have work commitments. This movie is trash. It's almost as bad as the director's acting in godfather 3 Based on the book by Priscilla, you see how a young lady lets a famous person influence her decisions until she finally realizes everything in her life revolves around his every wish.
 After Priscilla becomes pregnant, Elvis tells her he wants the two of them to take a "" break from their relationship"". She says just let me know when you want me to leave, he says he doesn't want her to leave, then she begins seeing newspaper reports of him being out on the town with his latest costar.
We see how controlling Elvis was & how this was the beginning of their marriage ending. Rarely do we get to know the titular character in detail, but Coppola's tale of a teenager's life thrust into adulthood and left stagnant by toxicity is shown with care. Too much Elvis content in one decade I read the book and was really excited for this movie but it was a bit of a let down. I know it's not an action film but it wasn't very exciting and I felt bored throughout most of it. Also, I felt like Elvis and Priscilla were just whispering the whole time, and Priscilla in particular barely showed any emotion, even when she was supposed to be really happy. Just wasn't buying their love story and felt like I was watching stiff performances. Jacob did a good job as Elvis but half the time I wanted them to speak up so it took away from his portrayal of him. It wasn't a horrible movie, but I don't think I could ever rewatch it. The film's solid pacing is its best side. Never go down. Cailee Spaeny's cuteness also keeps you going. But movies lack spice. There should be something more dramatic, I guess. Like the movie, but it could have been much better. Two big problems: one, there is no story (so the perfect film for Coppola). Two, after Austin Butler there is no other Elvis. Everything I was afraid it would be. Unless you are really obsessed with the age gap between the two you might want to skip it. I thought it was very dull. The story line could have been a lot better. She barely spoke and this was suppose to be about her life with Elvis. Not a very good movie. We can get a small glimpse into an icons life, but it's an important glimpse. It's very slow moving and you could do with subtitles to understand Elvis the sound is awful and the lighting you will definitely not need a sleeping pill 💊 Great movie. They aged Priscilla really well and really gave her the spotlight as opposed to the Elvis movie with Austin Butler. Jacob also plays a better Elvis than Austin. it was so rotten! poor Lisa Marie that her father was portrayed like that A well performed movie about the life of Priscilla Presley. The girl playing Priscilla was actually prettier than the real Priscilla. Shows his side of Elvis that many didn’t know. Like didn’t know he was a smoker and he took lots of pills. I can't understand how anyone would find this movie enjoyable. ""Well acted"", you've got to be kidding. Maybe Elvis bit the actress playing Priscilla was horrible. The Priscilla Presley biography radiates in the hands of Sofia Coppola, who delivers subtle tenderness between moments of brilliant acting and respectful storytelling. There's a reason Lisa Marie didn't approve of the script. It felt like the film purposely trashed Elvis at every opportunity while portraying Priscilla as the victim who was completely helpless. Sofia Coppola is such a great director but I didn't enjoy this film at all."
Drama,oppenheimer_2023,"Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation. That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages. While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most. I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by Oppenheimer had no voice. Nuclear noir spectator sports, a poison apple metaphorically intimating apocalyptic original sin, bombs, bombshells, and that buried Operation Paper Clip elephant in the room.  Nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling, dynamic fashion. Oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't get at least a few Oscar nominations. A suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career. An intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted biopicture about the kinds of events that are hard on the heart.
 With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous. In a movie about impending global catastrophe, he gives a close-up of a face, and a twitch of a lip the power of an atom bomb. Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time. What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish] His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance... A cinematographic marvel by all measures. [Full review in Spanish] The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come. Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade. Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives.  [Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures.","Photography and acting were very good, story editing annoyed me for some reason.  In 3 hrs there was no time to even touch the subject of the generations on victims from the Los Alamos area and in Japan? The type of movie that you cannot help but think about afterward. Watch a 2 hour documentary afterward. Google. Change your perception of things. Easily one of the best pieces of art produced. Nolan at his best. Outstanding directing. Overall incredibly effective film. Worth the time. This movie was an absolute modern classic! In my opinion, it is the best film of the year 2023. It's a masterpiece from the direction, the performances, the soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson is one of the best since Dark Night. Cillian Murphy is masterful in his performance and is favorite to win the Golden Globe and the Oscar for Best Actor as well as RDJ for his role as Lewis Strauss. I did not want to watch then It amazed me.welldone! Not sure what anyone sees in this movie. It's full of itself, music too loud and overdramatized, jumping around nonsensically, no real story of interest being told, too long, boring dialogue, etc. One of the worst, overhyped movies I've seen in a while, and I understand the science behind it too. Woof. Good movie, enjoyed every bit of it. Best movie I have seen all year!! I have watched it 4 times now! Personally, I found the first hour a total bore and so I never finished the dvd. I know it has rave reviews but I was familiar with the story and I just couldn't get into this version. Previous movies about this story were far better in my opinion. Brilliant cast & acting.  Great screenplay. It does jump around in the timeline so, you need to pay attention Fantastic film chronicling a very interesting time in our history, great performance by Cillian Murphy and great direction by Nolan A disjointed mess of fast paced scenes that mostly last less than seconds on the screen, and yet trying to tell what was a compelling life about a fascinating person and time. It was well intended but this is a story that could have benefited greatly from well developed scenes told in a straightforward manner and not flashback, flash forward, and flash sideward. The man was obviously a brilliant but troubled character with some interesting relationships besides being primarily responsible for a world changing event. Yet none of these paths are ever fully developed and if you blinked in certain scenes you missed the message. What did we learn from the sex scenes with Jean for example - Nothing about anything.  What is with this fast paced, scenes for a second, that directors all of sudden are doing as if because faster it told a better story?  It doesn't. Try watching a brilliant David Lean movie. I was blown away! Pun intended!! Excellent movie It's as if a science documentary was turned into a thriller. Brilliant. Powerful movie. Really gives you a sense of the dilemma that they went thru to built a world destroying bomb. A movie that takes it time to tell a story can be a wonderful thing. This is not. It's is laborious, strangely not engaging and unintelligible at times. Oppenheimer was rich in character development and intelligent, mind candy  dialogue. The three hour length was necessary to tell the complete story, and Im not complaining about it as it flew by. 

I enjoyed it even more on the second viewing it was so full of nuanced dialogue and superb acting. 

Its one of those epic pictures that will stand the test of time. Great movie, sex scenes seemed forced and out of place but still a great movie It was the only time I left the movie theater, before the movie was over!"
Drama,napoleon_2023,"It’s one thing for a movie to not care for human insight. It’s another for it to fail to engage with conflict in any meaningful way, inside or out. It’s clear, I think, that in spite of various attempts to make Napoleon work as a biopic, the film doesn’t have a bio. It has a general of genius, something like a sports figure who is alive only in games or tournaments. Epic battle scenes but the personal story is lacking. It feels as if Scott is flipping the bird to a film industry that takes itself too seriously. Known for his prowess in historical dramas, Scott's latest endeavor falls short in grasping the complexity of Napoleon's rise and fall. The film is visually impressive, but it is not emotionally stirring. The heart of it was not as exciting as it could be in terms of the emotions. I have mixed feelings on this film.   While there's no immediate lesson to be found in ""Napoleon,"" one might yet be found in director Scott's upcoming 4-hour version. I'd recommend waiting. It’s definitely not your typical portrayal of a famous historical figure, and the better for it. You’re not going to have a complete picture of the events that comprised Napoleon’s life, but you might just have a better understanding of who the man was and why we’re still so fascinated by him over two centuries after his death. I don't want to assume anything yet, but you can't help but wonder given the editing here that this might be another KINGDOM OF HEAVEN situation.  It doesn’t really take a historian to appreciate that a lot of liberty’s have been taken here. Equally, it doesn’t take a psychiatrist to know that Scott barely scratches the surface of Napoleon’s psyche. [Joaquin] Phoenix's penchant for dry, understated performances turns this one into a downright comedy, a Wes Anderson character study trapped in a Steven Spielberg period drama ... Where does Napoleon start when Phoenix never seems to end? War is hell, of course, in Ridley Scott’s biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte. But for viewers of this film, safe in their cinema seats, it is also inescapably magnificent. Napoleon offers so much. And yet it leaves us wanting more. Despite all the history, the battles and the politics, this movie stays on track as a personal story. This makes Napoleon and Josephine characters in the story who are easy to relate to, as well as being a strong focal point for the film. It is fascinating watching Phoenix play Bonaparte like he's a gamer who's constantly on the verge of rage quitting. Ridley Scott's newest film, Napoleon, suffers in its storytelling from the many historical inaccuracies that plague the picture. The mediocrity of the film does not reside in the distance from the character who supposedly inspires it, but in the lack of narrative progression and the lack of depth it reaches. [Full review in Spanish] Napoleon paints a pleasingly knotty, often unflattering portrait of its protagonist (who is shown as shrewd in battle, vulnerable in love and socially ill at ease), and is full of quirky, often humorous details and dialogue to savour. Mr. Phoenix's Napoleon could never have commanded so much as a squadron of the Salvation Army, and though the movie is sprinkled with a few reasonably hearty battle scenes, overall it's something like Mr. Scott's Waterloo.","Very well told story, excellent acting and outstanding soundtrack! Joachim Phoenix was terrific as Napoleon, having just the right amount of audacity and attitude.  Though historical liberties may have been taken, the movie was riveting and kept my family thoroughly engaged. The special effects were amazing and convincing. Jaquin is an amazing actor, but the rest was pretty lame. Napoleon in the Marvel Universe

Save your money and watch it on TV
Someone may even like the movie, but the movie is bad. See that they are different things
Whoever found a good movie, maybe they should do an urgent skull scan

The movie doesn't work, it has no plot, it has no context, it seems like it's a collage of scenes independent of each other

In the end, the feeling is of waste. A gigantic production, excellent costumes, well-produced battles (from a visual point of view)

To get out a mambembe and cliché thing. It's almost like Napoleon in the Marvel Universe, leading a cavalry charge in the middle of the battle of Waterloo

- If you want to be kind to Ridley Scott, although I don't think he deserves it, because he is very arrogant, he was a victim Of the magnitude of the story I wanted to tell, condensing 25 years of events in 160 minutes. It didn't work and it got worse, which would already be difficult

- This is remarkable in the film's omissions. The film simply EVEN MENTIONS Spain, the battle of Trafalgar, Ney or Murat It was the worst movie I have seen in years! Dont bother spending the money. Long drawn out babble.  Not to mention inappropriate sexual scenes that were not necessary.  The dialogue was terrible, difficult to hear and looooong! Not a historical epic or a perverse love story. Yuck. Overall it was a good movie, not great but solid.  Focused too much on his love life with Josephine and not his genius battle techniques and ways of conquering.  Would have liked to seen more battle scenes and more strategic planning for war, Joaquin Phoenix did a good job playing Napoleon but I expected a more serious tone from him, after all Napoleon did almost conquer everything! Slow moving, boring.  My wife fell asleep.  Mis casting of Napoleon.  He was terrible. Very slow and seemed to focus on his relationship with Josephine more than I expected.  Would’ve liked to have seen more of his conquests. Fantastic movie with some amazing battle scenes. Excellent performance from JP who played the part of nepoleon very well. Me and the missus were hooked from start to finish! It fails to tell a compelling story. The film is mostly concentrated on a few nice war scenes and Napoleon's sex life. Seems to me like Ridley Scott didn't care to make a movie about a French emperor who led one of the most successful empires in history. Instead I was forced to watch an uncomfortable 2+ hour porn film about a sensitive sex addict. How do we go from Blade Runner to this garbage? 

Truly disappointed.

Truly disappointed Only Hollywood bs, a mockery of history, a mockery of a movie and a mockery of my time No character development, no cohesion in the story and no drama anywhere in the movie. The few battle scenes are interesting and well made but there's plenty of other movies where that's the case. Let's not even talk about historical inaccuracies. Feels more like the director was mad at the French and just made a cheap hit peace. Maybe he got rejected by a French girl once NAPOLEON 
For a film where the protagonist has the word ""boner"" in his name, this is the flop of the year.
Very disappointing as Scott and Phoenix are masters of their craft, however it lacked their usual cutting edge.
There was hardly a French word spoken and not even an attempt to incorporate an accent by any of the cast. 
It felt like a ""rom-com"" where they wanted to cast the Joker for this role, not Phoenix. 
It lacked any build up to the major historical events of the time and what should/could have been a historical epic masterpiece was instead an epic fail. Movie is like reading the extreme cliff notes version on Napoleon with glossing over so many important events and played by an actor a bit too old for the part. This is one of Ridley Scott’s less impressive films. A historic look at Napoleon Bonaparte, I am a history buff & I did enjoy learning more about the General, but there were times I wasn't clear on the plot at hand on the screen. 
If you don't like history I would not advise watching because I like history & places confused me about what was occuring. Very interesting about him with his rise and fall. I did learn quite a bit about him ego and personality. Horrible boring movie. Left before it was over. Had so much potential and they dropped the ball Less war and more creepy love story than we expected. The story was very interesting, the actions did an excellent job."
Drama,animal_2023_2,"Trashy, idiotic, and filled with disgusting bloody violence that's overly repetitive, Animal is excruciatingly too long at 201 minutes. This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal’s terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India’s religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can’t be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked interludes alike are not without skill, but get kick-dropped into an inorganic whole uninterested in integrating them to sustained, logical or emotionally credible effect. During the interval, I was at a loss of theories. I didn’t know what to make of him or the film. All I could ask was: What’s the point? Why is Animal? Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling. Reptile-eyed even at his smouldering best, Kapoor’s career-best performance makes Animal tough to stomach, but equally difficult to ignore. Ranbir Kapoor's action tale is flawed, overtly violent and misogynistic...","Suberb movie ranbir's acting is spontaneous 🔥 The movie dragged a lot...Overkill.
Starts off interesting but ends up with a bitter taste..

Narcissism, gaslighting, adultery, short tempered, anger issues, daddy issues, detachment issues ..and the list goes on..

Had to detox my brain just for watching this movie🧠 Sat down for the entire 3hr 20min and didnt get bored. Animal movie is the collage of the insta reels put together unimaginably, to ignite the spark within the youth with low IQ and even lower span of attention. But that is what an Indian audience will get, who grew up on Salmanolothic and Govindaesque mindless flicks of 3 hours. What a waste of so much talent, but a much appreciated effort by the post production and marketing team to make this project a monetary success. Amazing movie, 10 out of 10 “The Arab middle easterners are here; the Arabs are here! Can I rate this 0/5?
Mysogynist director and his pathetic script. This movie disgusts me.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga definitely is disturbed in the head to make movies like this one and Kabir Singh LOL. Top notch acting, music, action. Excellent performance by Ranbir and all other co-stars. It has some short comings, but is perfect combination of top class acting, music, action, emotions, family and relationships. Waste of money and time Bollywood has once again proved that it can't parallel Hollywood.

Animal is among the longest movies of the Bollywood, spanning over 3 hours 20 minutes. Yet it's a total waste of time. Even the title has no direct connection with the plot. 

The attempt is to present a deep psychodrama of father son relationship. But the plot is a thorough failure. But no doubt, the performance of Ranbir Kapoor is good and spreads colors on the canvas.

Yet the youth will love this movie as it shows brotherhood and stubborn attitude.

Overall, the film is a tasteless amalgam of action and emotions. It's better to watch some stock drama than to waste time on this fazool film. It makes sex unsexy and for a movie with this budget very shitty editing Absolutely endearing story of a sons love to his father and his family. Must watch for any Bharatiya. I think this movie has a negative impact on society. A little over the top but definitely worth a watch for mature audience. Worst movie ever. That much violence is insane and would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of time. What the f*ck did I watch! First 40 minutes were too abrupt and quickly stitched to try to make a point which wasnt landing. Action sequences were the savior amidst weak acting and characters played by Anil Kapoor. Outstanding Performance by Ranbeer Kapoor !! Unbelievable movie! Too much violence and not family oriented Excellent movie. Love to see the father and son bonding."
Drama,saltburn,"Entertaining but the movie seems to have been patched together from other familiar movies. Films about English class privilege used to be sane, continuing a proud tradition. Now the worst people in Hollywood make films about the worst people in the world. Fennell sells attitude to replace knowledge and feeling. Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' examines envy, classism and a murky romance in the shadow of a gothic-tinged mansion. But for all its ambition, the film falls short in how it tells its seemingly audacious story. [Full Review in Spanish] The sexual groveling of Oliver is akin to the social groveling of anyone who worships the ultra rich simply for being rich. Director Emerald Fennell continues to prove she is one of our most creative storytellers with Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi giving standout performances.  Stupid careless rich people are always entertaining even if there's absolutely nothing new being said, and the numerous scenes here where class and status is undermined and then re-enforced have an engaging energy to them. I admired SALTBURN's boldness, but as a dramatic and thematic exercise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  With excellent acting, arresting visuals and art direction to die for, this is one of the most original movies to be released in years. Possesses an originality re obsession that is deeper than the surface. Barry Keoghan's Oliver uplifts the emotions in his situations, and the supporting cast shines, especially Carey Mulligan and Rosamund Pike in key story moments. w/Emerald interview. Saltburn embraces that universally cosmic dread of being a revolting human being and builds an extravagant labyrinth of a castle on top of it. Saltburn is disgustingly mesmerizing, and Barry Keoghan gives the perverted performance of a lifetime. Emerald Fennell’s latest provocation is tasty fare, if a bit unclear about who’s the main course. Saltburn will get the town talkin’ that is for damn sure. Will this conversation stand the test of time? All signs point to: NO.  Consistently amusing—the film namechecks Evelyn Waugh, but the sardonic tone feels closer to Kingsley Amis—and the actors are a blast to watch interact with each other. The shock value here is quite....forward, but don't let that get in the way of the absolutely fierce performance by Barry Keogan.  Mr. Keoghan has an uncanny ability to come across as shifty and devious even in repose, and his performance is the key to the movie. It is through its unapologetic manipulation that a movie which might easily otherwise have been just another mindless, lurid thriller [turn] into a savage piece of cinema that you’ll want to see again and again. Unlike ""Promising Young Woman,"" it doesn’t tap into the rage of its day. It’s just purposelessly unpleasant. It’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley” meets “Call Me By Your Name” — insidious, class conscious, with a bit of violence and a serious taste of the sexually kinky if not downright icky. Fine, disreputable fun until what might be the stupidest, most misguided ending I’ve seen since… well, since Fennell’s previous picture. Fennell’s stunning visuals and Barry Keoghan’s excellence lift ""Saltburn"" to must-watch status.","I’m not sure what to think of Saltburn. Yes, wealthy people can be cruel but I think hating them and plotting their demise makes one worse. It’s worth a watch and not at all what I expected. And, there are a few weird sex scenes to go along with this weird film. Where to begin... it's weirdly good. Absolutely loved the movie.  I felt as an audience member that I was being respected as an adult.  Overall A++++++ Beautifully shot and acted - the first 3/4 are superb but it ends a little lackluster (although love Barry's buns) Saltburn is Brideshead Revisited reimagined. Filled with sharp cutting dialog and wild plot twists it provides a very enjoyable and funny ride.  Excellent performances by all including Barry Keoghan Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Archie Madekwe Slow paced, somewhat predictable, I felt it would never end,  almost walked out of the theater several times! If you occasionally would like to see redeeming or sympathetic traits in a movie's characters, you won't find it here. Push this envelope into the trash. A smart, twisted satire about the dark qualities of humanity. Incredible performances. Just dreadful, it was supposed to be a dark comedy.. The hell was that? This is a fiendishly crafty satire about a poor young scholar, Oliver, up at Oxford who is at first exiled with the nerds. From this vantage point he can only see from a distance the cool kids and the pretty boys and girls. But slowly, and gradually, he wins acceptance and befriends Felix, a popular and aristocratic student who lives in a great big beautiful country house. Oliver gets invited back to the stately home known as ‘Saltburn' and Felix's eccentric family embraces, in their way, Oliver, and Oliver, in his way, embraces them as well. Things get weird, then things get surprising, but it's a joyous, neon-lit, loud-soundtrack film full of beauty, treachery, and debauchery, befitting the long English tradition of such. It has been a long time I have felt something, after Saltburn I was chocked in ways I have not been in years. Great actors and beautifully filmed. Depressing, depraved and pretty disgusting Saltburn is wild, dark, disturbing and absolutely delightful, and I really can't explain why I enjoyed this wild ride of a story as much as I did. It's like ‘Succession' meets ‘Rocky Horror.' Plus, the retro song list is a hoot; from T. Pain to the Pet Shop Boys, and a song I somehow missed in the 2000s, ‘Murder on the Dance Floor' by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Now I can't get that earworm song out of my head. 

Two thumbs way way up. A psychological thriller drama with twits they imply are coming but still leave you surprised The best movie I've seen all year Best movie of the year easily I wasn't gonna bother going to watch this I thought just another boring English movie but it was really good great acting great story can't believe it's British movie The ride is decent enough but very predictable. You know what is going on before the movie decides to tell you what is going on.  It tries so hard but alas it does not surprise. This movie made me physically ill. It seems some are fans of that feeling. Not for me. I haven’t been religious since I was a child but I may burn some palo santo and say a prayer tonight. The freak deadass ate his way to the top( and I meant that literally and figuratively)"
Drama,the_holdovers,"...a deliberate yet increasingly enthralling drama... This is Mr. Hunham rediscovering his dignity and purpose, and it is Payne delivering his masterpiece the eighth time out... Their circumstances initially seem obvious, but David Hemingson’s script turns in a few twists, leaving in a bit of edge while maintaining an overall sense of warmth—the kind that makes nice holiday viewing. Working from a script from David Hemingson, Payne has crafted a wonderful story of loneliness and isolation that manages to be both inspirational and uplifting.  … you leave the theatre with a renewed sense of what it really means to be human. Da'Vine Joy Randolph is amazing in this as well. The uncommon movie these days that really does earn laughs and tears. A touching drama that infuses acerbic wit with sincere platonic love, convincingly delivered by Giamatti, Randolph, and newcomer Sessa. The comedy is perfectly blended with loneliness, producing a memorable story that can make you laugh and cry. The performances by these three lead actors are all superb, and they had to be in order for this movie to work this well with such a small cast.  Whether it’s putting your money where your mouth is or refusing to stay on the sidelines, people make the right choice if their convictions are true, consequences be damned: the essence of being a Barton man. There are surprises to be found in The Holdovers, but they come from the characters, not the story — from the ways each of the three main figures reveals new depths and confounds expectations. In Payne’s work, one individual’s foibles and failings can open another’s perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director’s greatest films. The way Paul Giamatti tip toes between teacher, paternal figure, friend and even combatant is nothing short of sublime. Hunham’s hero Marcus Aurelius once wrote, “Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing.” Take his advice and see this film. The Holdovers delivers in every way. It is a genuine and heart-warming story with complex characters. Paul Giamatti gives his most memorable performance to date, and this is arguably Payne’s best work.
 There’s something elastic to Giamatti’s performance as Mr. Hunham, particularly in his face: he never lacks a wide-eyed stare or a clenched jaw; it’s a masterpiece of miserly annoyance, he’s the king of put-upon stiffs. The Holdovers, after being stuck in the snow for too much of its more-than-two-hour runtime, does eventually land in an emotionally satisfying place. The best way to describe Payne’s ninth feature is to say it’s remarkably ordinary. A quality that applies to most of his films that are warm, quiet, and inherently funny meditations about unexceptional people leading a simple life. There are so many touching and subtle scenes in this film. So well done.  Alexander Payne has created a wonderful holiday movie about finding a sense of family and caring for others in the least expected places.","Extremely well acted, and emotionally resonant. A satisfying ending to an overall heartfelt story. The Holdovers holds you over its two hours with beautifully flawed characters and a story simple but oh-so-effective at evoking a wheelhouse of emotions. The Holdovers is a rare movie nowadays, with its sincerely human story and layered characters. It's a believable movie that makes you feel various emotions, from laugh-out-loud happy to teary-eyed sad. The actors were remarkable in showcasing the dimensionality of their roles, especially Paul Giamatti, who gave an incredible performance. It's also beautifully shot with a vintage look that resembles the feel of 90s movies. It is mellow, however, and the slow pace of events can get dull, but it remains an enjoyable movie. This is a good coming of age story set at a new england boarding school in the 1970s with interesting characters. Holdovers is a delightful movie for those who like leave the theater just a little different than when they walked in, with a slightly different perception of life and the values we hold dear.  A thought-provoking movie with layers of messages. The casting is perfect, the storyline is emotionally packed with humor and wit. Loved it! This is one of the best Christmas movies I've seen so far. I thought there were really excellent messages, about family that were really strong, and will probably resonate with most people during the holidays, and I thought the comedy was amazing. I was laughing through the entire movie. The acting was also excellent, and it had the charm of a classic 90s Christmas movie while still modernizing it a little bit. By the end of the film, I was in the Christmas spirit. That's why I recommend putting The Holdovers on your wish list to watch this year. An instant classic. This movies captures a myriad of human emotion: comedy, happiness, jealousy, and heartbreak to name a few. A must watch this holiday season! Loved it!Excellent story, acting and screenplay. Not an Alexander Payne fan but I really loved this movie.  It captures the feel and look of the 70s while exploring themes that resonated then and now.  Excellent acting across the board. It's rare to see a movie just sit with itself anymore. Everything has to be such huge set pieces or some larger than life situation but not here. In many ways this movie is a refreshing throwback to the era I'm which it's set. Just a movie about people being people. I know this isn't going to win any Oscars but it definitely deserves them all the same. Well written. Reminiscent of a good John Irving novel. This generations less-polished, more real Dead Poets Society. Lovely, warm-hearted and lovable. Giamatti as always brings so much more to the show than what he is given on the page. What's here is good you just wish there was a little bit more. Only the teacher and pupil flesh out at all the other characters are 2-dimensional. A strong freshman effort? Or one and done true-to-life tale with nothing else in the creativity tank?  Capture the 70s tone perfectly but too reliant on long close-ups of thoughtfully posed actors. You start to feel like an awkward wallflower at the party struggling for something to say which may be the point of this comIng of age film. A very well crafted and touching story with great performances. Pitiful at times but elating overall. A very entertaining watch. The Holdovers might have just become my favorite film of the year. There is something magical in the simplicity of showing flawed characters from all angles. All of the film's elements come together to, essentially, demonstrate the magic of Christmas without the sticky, sappiness that so many others rely on. Instead, we are woven a tale that feels simple and real, driven by satisfyingly paced character and relationship growth. I can not recommend this enough, especially for the holidays and for folks who are suckers for a found family. Job well done to all who worked on this film! Poor writing, weak acting. Nothing new to see here. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen other times. I really enjoyed this movie. It is a little slow at the beginning, but is really intriguing beautiful story with great characters. It feels like it will be a christmas classic. Great Christmas movie! Gets your heart Terrific film that grabs your heart Believable human stories. Exceptional. Paul G is truly one of a kind. One of the best movies I saw in 2023. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. It really transported me back to the 70's and in loved every minute of it.  
I can't wait to see it again. The three performances by Giamatti, Randolph and Sessa make the film. One can argue that a few script contrivances (the process by which ""Angus"" gets left behind a prime example) trip the narrative up a bit but it's the three actors - especially Sessa, in a remarkable debut - carry the film to it's emotionally satisfying conclusion. Giamatti mines every once of nuance out of the curmudgeonly History professor and Randolph can do more with one gtare than most actresses working. Most definitely worth your time!"
Drama,poor_things,"Poor Things is a movie of unsavory urges and scratched itches that pull the viewer down a pernicious drain of unconscionable behavior. There's a dark comedy buried in the muck that curdles to the surface as our lead becomes the master of her own fate. Enjoyable, weird, bonkers and smart. What makes Poor Things a titanic—and undoubtedly long-remembered—film is how Lanthimos balances playfulness with far more intricate themes.  Pulling from horror, science-fiction, romance, and coming-of-age genres, Bella Baxter’s story is an enrapturing, sophisticated, deeply feminist one: Lanthimos firing on all cylinders.  Beautifully garish, wonderfully twisted, unabashedly raunchy and at times grotesquely striking... Poor Things is the latest evidence that it’s Lanthimos’—and Stone’s—Mojo Dojo Casa House. The rest of us are just living in it. Screenwriter Tony McNamara deserves credit for wrestling Gray's novel into a movie that Lanthimos fills with visual invention, twisted wit, and bizarre surprises. Poor Things constantly draws its viewers into an unpredictable story of self-discovery that is filled with unbridled creativity and brilliant acting, [Full review in Spanish] Emma Stone shines in film bogged down by third-act lectures on the Patriarchy. Emma Stone dazzles in this bizarre and wondrous fairytale. Stone’s performance is exceptional, sincerely portraying Bella’s development from infant to mature young woman... Director Yorgos Lanthimos’ film has all the makings to be one of the year’s best pictures  I never thought I'd want to see an R-rated Disney Princess film by Yorgos Lanthimos and after seeing this, I still don't.  Who knew Yorgos Lanthimos was the new James Whale. All hail the Bella Baxer of Emma Stone, she's alive alive. Yorgos Lanthimos' 'Poor Creatures' is a twisted version of Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. But also, an exploration of female sexuality, maturity and evil, in the midst of a dark comedy. [Full Review in Spanish] Stone commands each and every scene in which she appears (which is very nearly every scene in the movie), and I strongly suspect that Bella Baxter will go down in the pantheon of unforgettable screen characters. Lanthimos takes the social experiment from his breakthrough film Dogtooth in a more crowd-pleasing and comforting direction. Through it all, Bella claims center stage; and whether she’s acting as an innocent or a sophisticate, Stone has no problem anchoring the chaos. unmatched as a visual experience, not as jolly as Lanthimo’s The Lobster, but exquisite, clever, reasonable, and masterful, whisking us away to new ideas, but be warned, it’s a lot.
 The narrative feels long, but the themes and character growth we're shown are tragic, beautiful, and marvelously gripping. You'll be blown away by the beauty of the visuals, but even more entranced by the magnetism of Stone. If not all parts coalesce into a fully successful whole, the cinematic recipe is still a delectable feast worthy of careful consumption.","I am not a fan of child/disability porn, which is essentially what this movie was. If someone's brain is of an infant/child but their body is an adult it's creepy at the very least. ""Poor Things"" might just be one of the best films not only of the year, but of the decade. Yorgos CONTINUES to be the goat with his adaptation of Alastair Gray's original book, and his style, the production design, the weirdly morphed animals, and the mechanics of this world are all unforgettable. The score from Jerskin Fendrix is most definitely my favorite of the year, and it certainly has my hope for an Oscar win. Emma Stone gives the greatest performance of her career, Mark Ruffalo plays a great bumbling manipulator, Christopher Abbott plays an amazing goat, and Willem Dafoe absolutely kills his role again. Everybody in the cast and crew knew the assignment. This is an absolutely portrait perfect, gorgeously shot and edited film that had the upmost care contributed to it. This film is one of the many reasons why I love cinema. Time flew watching this movie. If you know the directors past work then you know why.  You might not like everything that happens but dammit you will be entertained. Very enjoyable and full of fun shocking moments. I can't stop thinking about this movie. Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Willem Dafoe all give amazing performances. Incredible to look at as well. It has so much to say on so many levels I don't even know where to start. Witty, visually stunning, touching, and one of Lanthimos’ best. Waited months to see it. The movie is a piece of art and needs time and space to be analyzed. Not for people who go to movies for purely entertainment or thrills I’ve seen 50 movies this year at the theater. This is by far the worst movie of the year. I walked out. I never walk out of movies. I love the movie and cat was great Absolutely not. 2 hours of watching Emma Stone act as a mentally delayed individual, then act as a child getting railed over and over. Visuals and script are the only saving grace of this film. The entire film was uncomfortable and boring. Never left a movie review for any movie but had  to warn anyone thinking about seeing this disaster of a moviedont do itlove Emma Stone  but not sure why she stooped so low to make this bizarre degrading movie. Absolutely the worst movie, we shouldve left when the couple next to us walked out about an hour in, but thought it would get better, unfortunately got about 10 times worse. Beautiful movie! Production designer deserves an Oscar. Best screenplay from book, best cinematography, best actress, best film. A movie for the puke-vomit bucket list. Nearly one of the worst movies ever made, and I'm very sad to see Emma Stone play the role she did in this distressing and god-awful pile of garbage projected onto a movie screen. I'm actually very sad to see she would have accepted to play such a terrible role. Emma has done some excellent roles that I love and cherish, but this one was a role you should hope to see end up in the round file and never do such filth again, no matter what the paycheck is. I love that some people absolutely hated this, thas because it's not a movie, it's a FILM and its not for simple minded people with short attention span I absolutely loved it! Emma stone is PUURRRFECTION AND DAFOE KILLS IT AS USUAL! HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FOR MONTHS AND IT DIDNT DISAPPOINT Horrible. Weird. Stranger than strange. Good acting cant save this movie. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.  Had to walk out before it was over. Great performances all around ( Oscar worthy). Lots of smart and mature laughs. This movie is not for everyone its a hard R Bella like.  Almost as good as furious jumping Such a gorgeous film, Emma Stone gives the performance of a lifetime and is just absolutely spectacular! Bizarre film!  But that's typical for Yorgos Lanthimos.  Not for the faint-hearted or those that tend to like more mainstream movies.  Emma Stone gives the performance of a lifetime and Willem Defoe gives ones of his best ever.  If you've liked this director's other films, don't skip this one. Amazing film. Epic unique story with tremendous performances especially by Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo."
Drama,eileen,"Falls flat.  Eileen is triumphant, a rousing directorial success from Oldroyd. It feels like we’re watching a Todd Haynes film as filtered through the lens of a Hitchcockian tale, with a late-story development that’s bat-bleep crazy but also gripping. Hathaway is a fitting avatar of sorts for the filmmaker... Played by Marin Ireland, [Rita] delivers a monologue more potent in its quiet denunciation of the crimes of the patriarchy and the oppression of women than the highly-touted speech in Barbie. Its mounting horror and outrage will harrow your soul. It looks great, it sounds nice, the performances are solid, but none of the choices feel inspired by character or story. It’s a solid, effectively unsettling psychological thriller that could have used a few narrative tweaks to improve the experience. When the dust settles, we're left with a sordid little yarn that sneakily satirizes the three models of femininity on offer in midcentury America: virgin, vamp and virtuous wife. [Olyroyd and Moshfegh have] transformed Eileen into the blackest of black comedies, to the benefit of all involved, especially for their two leads, Thomasin McKenzie and Anne Hathaway, who seize the moment by offering contrasting styles of camp. Eileen looks more forward than inward at the plot hijinks caused by playing God with traumatized people. Still, dimensionality be damned, there are worst sins than taking a wild left turn in a character study. Just when you think you know where this film is going, Rebecca drops a line that abruptly changes the direction of the plot, and the film becomes something very different. It’s a delicious WTF moment that is seldom pulled off with such impact. Eileen is a perverse delight about obsession and cruelty; William Oldroyd’s second feature is the follow up Lady Macbeth deserved. The character development and world-building are detailed and engaging, but the film is rushed at the end, creating an abrupt and stunted resolution that’s inconsistent with what came before. Anne Hathaway gives a completely delicious and wild performance in this original psycho thriller that will make your jaw drop.  Acrid erotic compulsion in [a] most peculiar pulp psychological thriller,... The needling noir, taking up class and matters carceral, is by Ottessa Moshfegh and her husband Luke Goebel. The first part of the movie is a slow-moving, uncomfortable character study. The story picks up steam with the combustible relationship between Rebecca and Eileen, and it really explodes in their confrontation with Rita Polk. Eileen is stiffness and discomfort as the movie feels like a powder keg of potential havoc. Oldroyd succeeds for much of the film before allowing it to crash and burn during a ridiculous third act in which credulity is casually tossed aside in favor of over-amped pulp.  The cast members' intriguing performances are the main reason to watch this psychological drama, which takes a very dark turn near the end. The movie is weakened by a vague ending that doesn't give the closure and answers that were given in the book. Eileen is a disappointing thriller because of the film's unrealized third act.","Disgusting depiction of a psychologist… Eileen Cumming Versus Come on Eileen ? The structure and emphasis of the movie give the climactic arrival point little sense. The basement scene a forced venue for a lot of overacting and possibly the most unlikely confession since Colonel Plum fessed up in the conservatory with his pipe. The movie manages to be slow (pounding dreariness) and scrappy. Hathaway is particularly badly cast. Those accents - Gawd! And I did read and very much like the book. Fine acting but was a stinker of a story. Very confusing with little plot...no solid premise.  Why? Great acting and engaging story line. I enjoyed it until the ending like so many other reviews have mentioned. This movie was at least carrying itself through an unsettling story line to just completely ruin it with a non-ending end. Acting and casting are great, very believable. But the ending is not. Proper story, effing ripping and a jolly good time WOT What I liked about the film was that it was so uncompromisingly real. It was a decent and surprising film with a very good cast and first rate acting. it wasn't predictable, and it wasn't trying to please. Given the nature of the two lead characters- the story played out in a way that was very realistic. I might have wished for a neater ending, and I am glad the director had the nerve not to give it to me. The film may not be for everyone, but it stayed with me for sure.  As good as Thomasin, Hathaway and Wigham are in it, Marin Ireland does a scene that is both powerful and sad. Worth seeing. Disappointed because it ended ""open end"",  Great acting, but there really was no ending...so she did the deed, but if there is no sequel to this movie I will be very upset, cuz I want to know HOW ON EARTH SHE WILL (OR WON'T) GET AWAY WITH IT....WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DR./IF SHE GOES BACK TO WORK AT SAME JAIL, HOW WILL SHE EXPLAIN IF CALLED AS A WITNESS AT A TRIAL, WHICH WILL SURLEY NEED TO HAPPEN THE CAR WILL BE ID'd, SO WILL EILEEN CONVINCE PEOPLE HER FATHER WAS DRIVING IT AND ""DID THE DEED""?  ALL THIS NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED ONTO A SEQUEL.  THIS MOVIE HAS LEFT ME HANGING. A great noir thriller. Loved it. You may think you know where this Hitchcockian thriller is going, but you don't. When the movie ends, you feel as if it should be just beginning. For a split second you say to yourself, ""what?"" Then, since you're smart, you get it. Artistic brilliance, from the acting, to the writing, cinematography, as well as musical score. There are so many layers to the movie…..it hung with me for days as I unpeeled the experience. The movie requires a sophisticated audience….not the normal pablum produced by the Hollywood corporate machinery. The casting is top notch.  Marin Ireland's one meaningful scene is chilling.  The plot is solid through the first half of the movie and there is an interesting twist towards the end but the conclusion is very abrupt and unsatisfying. Eileen starts off slow and measured perfectly and a bit tense, and right off the bat you know this is going to be an interesting movie.  Its a perfect time piece as absolutely nothing strikes you as off: the accents, the clothes, the cars, the attitudes especially, are soooo 1960. I was 7 then. 

I wasn't in the mood for a depressing movie but Eileen keeps it a bit light and not overdone. Still, Eileen is ignored and in her own world but highly imaginative -as you'll see when she fantasizes how she'd like to get out of her circumstances (many of them are really damn funny actually). 

This is Anne Hathaway's movie too and I've never seen her so enigmatic and mysterious and just sexy and wonderful.  If you're an Anne Hathaway fan just go to to watch her strut because she is something else dolled up in her Marilyn Monroe blonde wig. 

Surprise ending, but not disturbing somehow. Just unfortunate. But you know Eileen will emerge like a butterfly out it's cocoon! Going in, I thought this movie was going to be something totally different than it was. I watched in anticipation for something to happen, a conflict of some kind. But it never came. A slight change occurred during the second half of the movie. And then it was over. I felt this movie was only skin deep. It should have dug a little deeper into the storyline and the characters. Like I said, I was watching, waiting for something big to happen and it never did. I like the two lead actresses, but this movie, for me, was a disappointment. Starts off decent enough but man oh man it takes a turn that should not have been taken. In short, it becomes ridiculous. I hated everything about this film.  Literally nothing happens in the first 80 minutes (of a 100 minute movie). Let me start off by saying that Thomasin McKenzie is great in whatever role she plays and this film is no exception. With that being said the film itself starts off strong but it falls off around the halfway mark. Great acting, great settings, but overall a subpar storyline with a disappointing second half. Great acting but the ending fell flat Painfully depressing. Critics delight, damaged people doing terrible things. Run far, far away"
Drama,dream_scenario,"'Dream Scenario' by director Kristoffer Borgli and starring Nicolas Cage, explores instant celebrity and also, mass hatred. All through an allegory of celebrity with surrealistic overtones. [Full Review in Spanish]
 It rides on the success of the right performer pulling it off, and the actor’s own public persona helps—seasoned movie watchers know to expect something beyond the ordinary from Nicolas Cage and he proves true to form with the intriguing and strange... I still had fun with the film; it just crashed into a brick wall right when it seemed like it was hitting its stride and preparing to deliver the punch-line. DREAM SCENARIO features a compelling concept that at times is really intriguing, but sadly it's often at odds with the film's commentary on pop culture fads. It's a cunning take on media, both social and traditional, as well as pop culture. Director Kristoffer Borgli avoids tarting up his film with flashy CGI, schtick or an overly imposing score. He stands back and lets Cage do his brilliant best. … an engaging enough experience while it’s happening, but one that you’ll likely have trouble recalling when you wake up the next morning. Cage’s is a tremendous performance that anchors a very good film, a bitter pill chased with a tart cider. …isn’t an entirely satisfying film, struggling to balance media satire with an intense personal journey  but Cage’s memorably agonising performance makes it worth hearing out for anyone concerned about the shallow direction of today’s online discourse… While some of these threads are incompletely developed and others dropped entirely, Dream Scenario never collapses in formless entropy thanks in large part to Cage's open-hearted embrace of his character. ...doesn’t quite know where to go with its high concept. Thematically, Dream Scenario perhaps poses more questions than it is able to effectively answer. Nicolas Cage delivers a wonderful performance in “Dream Scenario,” a quirky dark comedy with fantasy and horror elements. This is only writer/director Borgli’s second feature after numerous shorts; he’s clearly a talent to watch for. Part social commentary on instant fame and fast celebrities, Dream Scenario is a wild ride of The Floor is Lava, where the floor is everyday life and the lava is an incessant 24-hour news cycle supplemented by quick-hit socials like Reels and TikTok. An edgy satire about modern celebrity that, as happens so often nowadays, stumbles toward the close but offers so much that’s good along the way that you forgive its third-act lapses. The good certainly includes Cage’s witty performance.   Dream Scenario takes a cautionary look at celebrity and cancel culture as it traces the fantastical plight of a nondescript, bespectacled, bald and bearded biology professor named Paul, hilariously brought to life by Nicolas Cage. Dream Scenario is worth watching for its clever premise alone, and the casting of Cage is inspired. The first act is the strongest, and as the narrative shifts to the third act, it loses sight of its thesis. The structure may challenge some viewers, but those who stay engaged will find plenty of awkwardness offering a distinct cinematic pleasure. It has more to say than anticipated, and while the message doesn’t feel fully explored, there is an originality to this concept that remains intriguing throughout. The way it seamlessly shifts between genres is impressive.","quirky story hilarious at times! Good Cage performance. Leaves the audience with an unsettled feeling, which is a positive. I didn't mind the farting scene, but overall I felt like the story could've used a good deal of tightening up. An ordinary man shows up in the dreams of millions doing seemingly nothing making him a celebrity of sorts. Then suddenly the same man turns violent in the dreams of millions of people & becomes rejected by society for something he never did. Being a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman and Ari Aster, I absolutely loved this. Can't stop thinking about it. And one of Cage's best acting performances. this was a strange, strange movie lmao. nic cage was easily one of my favorite parts of this movie - he was great as this awkward, ""everyday"" professor-turned-celebrity, and all of the little quirks he gave this character had me laughing constantly. most of the jokes in this movie hit for me, and i loved all of the dream sequences as well. they had a really entertaining comedy-horror blend to them.

however, i found the first half to be stronger than the second - by the time the second half came around, i felt like the plot started to wander a little bit and i wasn't really satisfied with where we ended up by the time the credits rolled. there's a lot of great commentary on fame, cancel culture, and capitalist profiteering as well, but i think those ideas would've landed better with a stronger ending, and i think paul's journey as a character would be more meaningful too.

that being said, i still had a smile on my face for a whole lot of this movie, and the first half was fantastic. with a great lead and lots of humor and creativity, i'd say to at least give it a shot, even if you don't enjoy it as much as i do. I think this is a critics movie. One that makes you think just enough to seem profound, but really just tries to hard in the end. Speaking of the end I think this movie would have received maybe one more star if the ending was not so terrible. Overall, it is the odd movie that I am glad I saw but would probably not recommend to others. Nicolas Cage and A24 was not the Dream I thought it would be I suppose using Nicolas Cage’s name will draw/lure an audience? Nicolas Cage really shines in this movie where he can easily share all the torments, flaws and awkwardness of his character while going more crazy in the dream sequence. The premise is so creative and offers great opportunity to play with drama, humor, surrealism and horror. 

Despite all of this, the movie fell flat here and there. It's mostly due to long scenes that while very funny at first stretches the joke to a boring point. The story doesn't take full advantage of its surrealist premise most of the dream lack imaginative visuals that you would expect from it. 

It's important to know that this movie is mostly an allegory about cancel culture but in the case when the victim who loose everything is not guilty of what he is accusing of. It shows how difficult you can apologize for something that you didn't do but still ruin your reputation and your life. It is an interesting and tricky point of view but this focus slows down the movie that should a use more of visual creativity and let us suffering with a character that just being unfairly hated without any chance to recover. It's a good take on not only the real life lore behind a man who was frequently popping up in dreams, but also how some of us feel so unseen and unheard in life and how that desire can go awry. 


The main character is pretty passive and bland, so when he finds out he's the exact way in dreams, it's deeply upsetting to him. He longs to be exciting, memorable, an active member of these dreams... then he meets the one exception to this, which is where the film takes a darker turn. There are many different meanings to this film (as with all art) and I find myself engaging with all of my thoughts of it. 
Recommended watch. Made me think. Made me feel for all the characters.  Great movie to talk about afterwards. Not the Nick Cage I grew up with, so glad he made this movie. Very A24. Not super dark. If you’re a Nick Cage fan and an A24 fan I’ll really like this one. Still  deeply thinking about it Interesting idea…. Nicholas Cage was perfect for this role. It was just ok. Love Movies that Feature Music by The Talking Heads. Dream Scenario is a good social commentary on fame and the damages that come with that. But it is difficult to care about the film's main character— making it difficult to care about the film as a whole. A funny, beautiful, and eloquently delivered satire. Loved every minute of it Provocative and seductive!  Well crafted to keep you involved and guessing! movie with a message....stop worshipping celebrities! Highly original, unpredictable, excellent flow, leading to a topical finale, humanity chooses to live in a dream enabled by technology, though some would really like it to be real. As easy as in a dream celebrities are made then destroyed, hero to villain transformation according to public perception. It's a movie with many layers. Cage is absolutely brilliant.  Another Oscar can be expected for him for this role."
Drama,the_oath_2023,"The Oath is a faith-based movie about Judeo-Christian historical people, but this tedious drama is actually very soulless. The characters, story, and filmmaking are woefully generic, while the acting performances are dismally substandard. There are some well done elements throughout the film, but there are also moments where things collapse from the pressure. At various points resembling “Gladiator,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” and “Braveheart,” “The Oath” mixes elements of drama, action, romance, and fantasy to stirring effect. I appreciate the filmmakers' intentions, but pledging to watch 'The Oath' may cause severe regrets. It's certainly no sillier in any way that I could see than, say, Conan the Barbarian or the Lord of the Rings flicks. And it's at least as heartfelt. The fact that in terms of subject matter this is an unusual film doesn’t mean it’s a good one... it’s solemn, repetitive and unexciting.  Clunky, dull and undercooked while very low on thrills, suspense and emotional depth.  A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian “Last of the Mohicans” action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism’s foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","The Oath had great cinematography, beautiful music, and a compelling story. I want to see it again! This film is not perfect and not for everyone but I appreciated the way it explores the sometimes painful experience of being alone, with Moroni being the last of his people after the heartbreaking loss of his family, and imagines what it might have meant to him to find companionship. It is a plausible depiction of the Book of Mormon taking artistic license to imagine and tell details of the story that are unavailable to us while staying true to the book. Leaps and bounds ahead of any previous attempt at bringing the Book of Mormon to film, I hope this opens the door for more to come! So proud of Darin Scott for finally Making this happen!

This is a film I've been looking forward to for years, as I've been following Darin all along.

This is my honest opinion of what I observed and felt during the film!

The overall cinematography was superb, with breathtaking shots of a beautiful backdrop!

The costumes, language, and set was phenomenal!

Some of the acting was on point and other scenes left a feeling that there was something lacking… room for improvement for sure. I feel like some of the lines were canned, where others could have been developed further.

I love the vision that Darin has, and the idea of bringing the Book of Mormon to life is fantastic…and I think the lead character could be someone more polished and believable in their portrayal of Moroni…there were so many scenes that were a bit too much…sort of cheesy…

There were also parts that left me wanting to see more…such as when Moroni tells of his fathers of the past…it would be so incredible to have flashbacks to the times and people he is referring to, with vivid real life portrayals…

Overall, I felt that parts of the movie landed, and others lacked impact…therefore leaving me feeling like it could have been better at the end.

I hope that filmmakers will continue to utilize the beautiful stories of the Book of Mormon and courageously follow the lead of Darin Scott to venture into a world where these beautiful and often tragic stories are brought to the big screen!

If I were to score the heart of the movie, I'd give it a 10…over all for me, it's a solid 6.5, maybe 7!

With love and a desire to offer honest feedback,

- Paul Absolutely loved it!! Great watch, motivating and inspirational, hard to find on the big screen now days! It was a bit slow for me but I enjoyed the story and its connection to the Book of Morman. For a nonmain stream big-budget movie, this was amazing. well written and the acting was outstanding. If you have ever wondered what the Book of Mormon is about, or who wrote it, here is your chance to discover some insight and be entertained at the same time.
As our nation is crumbling under disbelief, hear a message from our forefathers who lived on this land and speak to us from the dust, a warning, turn back to God and live. Finally this hero of ancient times comes to life in a quality production. I would like to see more films on this subject in the future. Some scenes of violence not always necessary, but one of the best inspiring movie to see this end of the year. Loved the movie, can't wait until it's out on blue ray. I really liked this movie. Ive been backing it for 13 years. It wasnt what I expected but I really enjoyed this. If this movie does well it means we get Reign of Judges. If this is an indicator i will be. Also the fight scenes were very realistic but  still exciting! Go Watch it! This is the first Latter-day Saint film with an epic feel--think Gladiator or Braveheart. But rather than a classic warrior-protagonist as in those movies, Darin Scott's Moroni is true to the character in the Book of Mormon - Moroni is masculine but he is a devout Christian, who spends his free time studying Scripture and in prayer. When I got home from watching the movie, I felt motivated to be better and to do better, because I had just watched a convincing, three-dimensional portrayal of what it means to be a godly man. You owe it to yourself to watch this film in the theater. Amazing production. The music and scenic shots were great. The acting was solid. Costumes and makeup looked incredibly legit. There were touching spots in the story despite sometimes moving a little slow. I hope to see more films like this made. I felt the creators tried very hard to give the film an epic feel this history deserves. That's hard to get across without explaining a little more of the history. I started to feel that more at the end of the movie but might have helped people understand if more history/substance was given in the beginning. Please keep making these! The Oath tells a compelling story with ambitious cinematography, minimal dialogue, and a simple plot. Job well done capturing the solitude of a man without community and his reintroduction to human interaction. The acting is subtle, with good character development throughout. What I appreciate most about Mr. Scott's writing, directing, and acting is the deep reverence for life shown. Where many films today explore the relativity of good and evil, Scott draws a useful line in The Oath: evil is to treat life cheaply and good is to hold life sacred. What's more, this demarcation rings true. Scott's invitation to viewers to hold human life and relationships sacred is a vitally important one. Peace can fill our lives and the world when individuals, families, communities respect life, extend forgiveness, seek reconciliation, and promote the good of the whole human family. I wish more mainstream media exhibited such vision and used its power for good. Bravo Scott and team for your bold commitment to sharing good and promoting peace. Wife and I thought it was amazing. The story was moving and portrayed the struggle of choice and consequences and the meaning of keeping true to your word.  The music was moving as was the breathtaking cinematography.  Highly recommend seeing this movie. I am so glad I decided to watch this movie.  The visuals throughout the movie were a feast for the eyes. The music score was amazing. The story was awe inspiring. I highly recommend watching this movie. You will leave the theater feeling better than when you arrived. -FREEDOM!- So cool to see Moroni come to life. It makes me put myself in his shoes and wonder if I could be like him. It is filmed in such a beautiful place.
Loved it This movie was incredibly well cast.  The cinematography was superb, and storyline was simply inspiring.  Darin Scott is a genius storyteller and even better actor. It was good. I did enjoy it. Not what I expected. Understanding the intention behind it, not sure if it got there. For a low budget film, it was done well with the music and cinematography. A little more help with the story and character depth and it would have been a phenomenal movie. Great music, acting and cinematography. But why does Aaron seem to have a pirate accent? Interesting spin on the untold life of Moroni after the plates were finished. I’m not Native, but I imagine some portrayals may be offensive to them. The story line was a bit slow and didn’t seem to pick up until King Aaron meets Moroni towards the end. Also, some of the writing didn’t make sense to me. I am an inactive member of the church, honestly I wasn't to sure about seeing this movie.
I went anyways to show some support. 

In the beginning I wasn't sure about the acting part of the lady that played the husband of   Moroni. However the acting picked up from there and was progressively way better as the movie went on. I liked having a storyline, I feel if there was no storyline in the movie, it would be like watching one of those boring movies they have you watch in church. 

My son brought his girlfriend who has never been exposed to the teachings of the Book of mormon and  she loved it, especially the relationship between the sisters. 

I really enjoyed watching the movie, if I hadn't I would have walked out and I didn't. I didn't even want to get up and go to the bathroom bc I was going to miss part of the show.

I have read reviews pertaining to Moroni showing and flexing muscles ect. Let me ask you, if you ran around in the forest for 20 years in survival mode and carried a set of encrypted gold plates around that weigh between approx 40 lbs consistently you to would have would be ripped too! 

Great job Darin and Michelle and cast. A love story showing that even the most evil people can change. Knowing and living the truth makes them free on earth and beyond earthly existence."
Drama,radical,"The film raises questions about various aspects within the field of education, urging us to reflect on the potential that each person carries within themselves, and the importance of discovering and implementing it. [Full review in Spanish] A perfect example of what a skillful, talented filmmaker, working from a sturdy script, a granular-specific setting... can do to elevate that formula into something altogether memorable and moving. Whether in a starring role or a supporting role Eugnio Derbez is always fascinating to watch. His role as an innovative teacher in this film is one of his best. The heart-warming true story is inspirational and relevant, and Eugenio Derbez delivers a powerful performance.

 ""...hardly radical filmmaking. But like teaching, if it reaches just one struggling student or one burned-out teacher, the film argues, it could well change the world."" They've had two hours in this slow, formulaic and manipulative film to make their point. But as much slack as we cut them for their sweet, well-intentioned ""hearts are in the right place"" effort, they don't quite manage it. Radical tells an impactful story about how inspiration can be found in unorthodox ways. Credible performances elevate this drama, which is based on real people — even when there's a familiar formula about a charismatic teacher who changes students' lives. The students are not child actors plucked from agencies, but genuine locals. Derbez’s interactions are thus charged with a special enthusiasm. Everyone feels real, because they are, and we genuinely feel for everyone involved. We should embrace Radical’s humanistic approach, which focuses on overriding negative stereotypes and outlooks. The result is a story that’s beautifully moving. Thanks to credible child actors and a not-so-funny Eugenio Derbez, the true story of Sergio Juárez Correa precisely reaches our hearts. [Full review in Spanish] Radical is a feel-good movie that earns its uplift, rather than force-feeding the desired emotional responses. Viewers' attention is held throughout by a story that combines funny moments with very touching ones. Eugenio Derbez offers his best work yet in this inspiring and wonderful true story film. [Full review in Spanish] You’ve seen this movie before; you probably won’t mind seeing it again. Eugenio Derbez is simply extraordinary in the lead role. A familiar crowd-pleaser told through a fresh cultural lens, this uplifting drama makes the grade despite adhering to narrative formula. If the script can sometimes feel a tad pro forma, the film still proves an authentically moving and involving crowd-pleaser.  Jennifer Trejo’s portrayal of the student with the most potential and the most emotional issues is particularly convincing. She adds to the solid central acting core. Eugenio Derbez (CODA), not only transforms himself and shows his chameleonic evolution, also shows the reality of his country with respect, affection and strength; the good, bad, ugly, hopeful and the beautiful. Don't miss it. [Full Review in Spanish]
 Derbez, one of the most well-known Hispanic actors in the world and a secret ingredient in CODA, lets us see the demons that torment Sergio and dwell right inside his head, but also drive him to greatness as a human being.","Totally Radical dudes Absolutely the best movie for 2023 to watch. I took my 87-year-old mom with my sister to see this movie. My mom was laughing, crying, and laughing again. A must-see movie. Go see it, you'll love it as much as we did, or maybe more. Good movie but Eugenio Derbez is just a clown, it would have been much better with another actor. Excellent film. Everyone should see this at least once. Very inspiring movie but I did notice an error when Paloma saw the SpaceX rocket through the telescope in 2012 but Elon actually decided on Boca Chica as the launch pad in 2014. Inspiring and real - every educator need a to see this movie Great movie. Love it. Very touching movie. BITCOIN RECOVERY MADE EASY BY LOST RECOVERY MASTERS

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did. I was so moved during and after the movie that I consider a total success.  Excellent movie! It was an inspirational story that makes you reflect in the opportunities we already have. muy interesante con la realidad en México  con la enseñanza educacional y la pobreza y pocos maestros que les importen los alumnos y que aprendan Moving, heartwarming, inspirational! Terrific! Such an inspirational movie with great performances, especially all the kids! Es una película que cae en el exceso de exagerar y obviar muchas situaciones. La actuación de Eugenio es bastante mala. Solid performances including those playing 6th graders coping with poverty, corruption, and fragile families. Vitality of Derbez's Sergio as he works to revive his own hope and the potential of his kids, while also managing suspicion and opposition. This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.  Eugenio Derbez gives a solid, immersive performance as a 6th grade teacher starting work with children whose lives are blighted by poverty and corruption.  Derbez's teacher wakes them to ideas and possibilities with creative, challenging methods. He encounters suspicion but also builds solid relationships--so satisfying.  Go see it! Una buena historia no muy compleja, buenas actuaciones y sobre todo muestra la realidad que todavia se vive en muchos lugares de mexico This was one of the best movies of the year.  Brilliant portrayal of the difficult task of teaching students with diverse backgrounds and economic status.  There are ways to reach these students but there is a necessity not to view everyone as the same and be creative with education. One of the best films of 2023 - concise and to the very moving point - a wonderful perspective on education and the talent/grace and care of dedicated teachers - who we should be paying a lot more money and respect toward.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough! This movie is a funny movie you are gonna laugh when you see this movie and is a motivation movie"
Drama,scrapper_2023,"Downbeat but uplifting. [Scrapper] finds some fascinating things to tell, and is charming in its form and conclusion, thus launching the career of a director who may have many more things to say. [Full review in Spanish] Charlotte Regan delves with delicacy and humor, without avoiding the dramatic aspects, into the clumsy but sincere relationship between a girl and her absent father... [Full review in Spanish] Amidst all the intentional artificiality of the filmmaking, [Campbell and Dickinson's] largely improvised interactions never ring false — a dynamic that’s crucial to making the movie feel genuinely touching and real rather than saccharine and shallow.  There is community and light to spare for some new (and nice) angry young people. [Full review in Spanish] Scrapper is constantly animated by a spirit of fun, as if Regan and her team couldn’t bring themselves to dwell too long on the sad bits. Scrapper refuses to be pigeonholed as another dreary story about working-class life. Grief has hope, youth holds the keys to everything. Scrapper director Charlotte Regan, who hails from this working-class London milieu, effortlessly captures how the community wildly crisscrosses in the shared spaces around their pastel, candy-colored flats. Director Charlotte Regan handles these matters with a candy-colored levity that can quite often be charming, in a whimsical, Wes Anderson way, but sometimes just plain baffling. A really remarkable directorial debut. It's a quirky, weird, delightful and offbeat film.  Think of it as the bastard offspring of Charlotte Wells’s Aftersun and Sean Baker’s The Florida Project, with a little Wes Anderson thrown into the mix... Even as it heads exactly where you’re expecting, her simple story grows just as likable and touching as it intends. Scrapper has the charm to burst through the coldest of hearts and win you over with whimsy, bants and working class joy. A poignant tale of rediscovery. Dickinson & newcomer Campbell shine in this gritty, yet heartwarming father-daughter narrative. A testament to resilience, growth, and the ties that bind. Delicately dancing the knife edge between too-cute and over-maudlin, the filmmaker and her terrific actors have given viewers that rarity in cinema: uplift without the dreary moralizing.  There’s scarcely a scene you won’t see coming a mile away, but it’s comforting when formulas are handled with this kind of care. Lola Campbell just [gives] a great performance... she and Harris Dickinson have really fun chemistry. I love this movie so much. This is going to end up in my top 10 list at the end of the year. Scrapper, a slight but moving slice-of-life set in urban London, is anchored by the central performance of Lola Campbell as Georgie Campbell is a revelation. This is her first movie role, and her performance is flawless.","I'm not crying, you are....a wonderful movie. Basically its about grief and coping and growing up. But it's still positive and charming. Wonderful. It's a very interesting movie with good acting and storyline. It's definitely worth the watch. The movie becomes interesting when the father shows up. It is a little dull before that time, and glorifying child thief and bicycle thief is not funny either. Funny, endearing, authentic. Terribly sweet. Slow moving, but well worth the time spent. Touching story of a kid who loses her mom only to have a unexpected dad appear This movie was a wonderful surprise.  It was billed as a comedy ... I cried my eyes out. A beautifully told and shot movie about grief It's a wonderful movie.  The happy ending may not be realistic, but harsh reality is not for everyone. A very nice and heartfelt little film. I love the main two character dynamics and the consistent happy-sad tone between most of the conventions between the two and throughout the film. I also love all the little camera tricks and storytelling mechanics that help push this not all too interesting of a premise more entertaining. It's a really good little movie, go watch it if you can. Beautiful movie bound for cult classic, movie hipster's selection territory. The scene work is so thoughtful and precise for such a simply shot movie. Lola Campbell and Alin Uzun are both amazing, for any age and any experience level, but to do that in their first films- wow. Harris Dickinson is a rising star. Funny, emotional, and knows what it is trying to accomplish. Loved it. Some good moments but overall, disappointing. Rather obscure at times Scrapper, the film by British filmmaker Charlotte Regan, is a heartwarming creation. It tells the story of Georgie, a 12-year-old girl who finds herself living alone in London following her mother's passing. When her estranged father, Jason, unexpectedly reenters her life, Georgie initially resists his presence. However, as they reconnect and spend time together, a bond forms between them, and they learn to rely on one another.

Scrapper is visually stunning with its colourful aesthetics. Lola Campbell's portrayal of Georgie as she brings resilience and determination to the character makes her genuinely captivating. Harris Dickinson also shines as Jason – a man striving to make amends for his mistakes.
The film strikes an uplifting tone while simultaneously exploring themes such as grief, loss, and abandonment. It delves into the significance of resilience, personal growth, and the importance of family – all highly relevant in today's society and culture, where adaptation to challenges is crucial. Regan skillfully balances these elements throughout the film without it becoming overly burdensome or excessively sentimental.

Scrapper is a well-crafted and delightful movie. It tells a heartwarming tale of strength, personal development and the significance of loved ones. Great acting and characterisation, poignant, gentle, real, funny - moving carefully and in a measured way through today's life. Highly recommended. A film that could turn any gay person straight. If the set up for writer-director Charlotte Regan's unexpectedly charming debut feels very reminiscent of last year's Aftersun, another British debut feature about a relationship between a young father played by a hot up-and-coming British actor, in this case Harris Dickinson, and a young newcomer, Lola Campbell, who avoids preciousness by playing the 12-year-old as if she's possessed by a much older soul, the tone of the films cannot be more different. Seen entirely through the eyes of Campbell's Georgie living mostly alone in her council flat, except for the occasional company of her bestie/bicycle thief accomplice, Alin Uzun's Ali, she's spending her summer holidays working through the 5 stages of grief after her single mom passed away; that is until Dickinson's Jason, her young estranged father, suddenly appears (in a hilarious but telling entrance) upending Georgie's life and forcing her to confront the uncertain future ahead. Set mostly within a fading pastel-coloured council estate, the realism here is tinged with a sense of fantastical optimism; while the humour in seeing the film through those juvenile eyes is further padded out with comical cutaways and mockumentary style side-narrations that are irreverent but cute. The tone here is more a British Sean Baker than Ken Loach, with a big dollop of Bogdanovich's Paper Moon especially in the emotional tug-of-war between the father and daughter, turning initial suspicions into something more heartwarming. Dickinson is initially enigmatic and cagey, but ultimately goofily loveable while Campbell and Uzun are naturalistic, engaging and bursting with innocence and energy. The ending does skirt towards sentimentality and the simple but moving story itself maybe familiar, perhaps even slight, but it has genuine heart at its core and at barely 85mins, this is the definition of short and sweet and a promising career opener for Regan. Very strong acting performances from the leads. Refreshing - albeit light in story - film about a daughter reconnecting with her father.  Lots of heart and a few humorous moments throughout. Scrapper is a small gem of a film. The British are very adept at producing humanistic and realistic dramas and this fine film is no exception. But it's not at all gloomy. Even with a tough subject matter it has a light touch and frequent laughs. Georgie is a 12-year-old girl who lives in East London. Her mother has died but she somehow manages to survive on wits and sometimes stealing. She keeps the social workers at bay by pretending she lives with her uncle. Suddenly her estranged father, Jason, turns up after living in Spain for most of Georgie's life. The film then becomes a story of both Jason and Georgie coming to terms with other. There are ups and downs and regrets and recriminations. This film feels lived in and totally honest. Performances are fine. Lola Campbell is a real discovery and Harris Dickinson builds on his previous strong work. A film small in stature but very well made and constructed. A great film, with brilliant performances and fantastic moments. Charlotte Regan’s film is an exceptional coming of age story. Really heartwarming. The Georgie actress is nothing short of an amazing talent.  So, so good."
Drama,fallen_leaves,"There is a Kaursimäki wonderland. He finds it in those unpromising, frosty, ashtray-littered locations. Fallen Leaves is one of the most wondrous of his films, and one of the simplest.  Pöysti delivers a small wonder of a performance, and turns her Ansa into a graceful symbol of survival. The filmmaking mimics the characters’ stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. In Kaurismäki's world, love (and of course, friendship) are the default solutions to survive a gray life, a mediocre job, and an inferior salary. [Full review in Spanish] Fallen Leaves delivers a lot in a short time. It's a story that finds a warm glow in an unlike;ly setting.  Kaurismäki’s latest sees him once again melding deadpan drama, pinpoint humor, and warm humanism into something refreshingly classical and true to his form. Faced with a bruised and battered world, Fallen Leaves merely soothes it, and that’s enough; of all the movies released in 2023, it’s the one with the most humane, satisfying ache. Pöysti is pitch-perfect throughout as a careworn woman with poetry deep down, as Ibsen said of Hedda Gabler.  The film has everything you would expect from the Finnish ironist: cool movie posters and retro pop ballads about love and heartache drifting out against a post-industrial backdrop of foundries and forklifts... Fallen Leaves runs for 82 perfect minutes, which in an era of overblown epics that numb your posterior, makes it a total joy.  With its droll, deadpan humour and poignant central story of two lonely souls connecting, it’s the closest Kaurismäki gets to a feelgood movie (albeit a feelgood movie with incipient liver failure). The twists and turns of Fallen Leaves aren’t so out of the ordinary, but they’re so exaggerated by the perplexity of its main characters as to constantly invite big laughs and unsure snickers in equal measure.

 'Fallen Leaves' feels just right, as if the universe itself had a deadpan sense of humor, playing a teasing game with the lovers.  Kaurismäki’s film manages a rare feat -- to be simultaneously touching and ironic. DROLL, sentimental, and quietly funny, this tale of two everyday Finns and their prosaic love story can’t fail to raise a smile. It’s a slight but captivating film, played with deadpan wit by Poysti and Vatanen. It’s a quiet, sweet, witty, moving Finnish-language drama about a relationship that slowly develops...  What is also familiar to fans of the director is the wry humor and impassive affect of so many of the characters. Underneath it all, however, beats a heart eager for love. Drolly scripted, impeccably designed and photographed, and played to succinct perfection, this may only be a slender drama, but it's also a cherishable summation of what makes Aki Kaurismäki special. Pöysti and Vatanen are perfect as familiar archetypes who still ring true. ","Kaurismaki with the same formula, same type of story, same type of characters, same type of dialogue and situations, same type of atmosphere.... And even then, it feels refreshing every time. It doesn't get tired. It always works. A delightful cinema Short: perfectly mellow.
Long: Hi. I hope and trust you're well. 
So this film is not true. But what it does do, is to make time, to focus on different acting techniques.
What happens? Un-spoiler alert. I'm still not sure, but I feel it is generally understood? that if one sees a lot of a character, that that character narrates the piece? Boy meets girl.
Opinion pls.
- With no real wish to make everything about my pet theory, this film is fine... 
-but the timing of it sort of makes it part of the fetish of Christmas...
-and so, that it is in Finnish, could be seen/ or heard as - Winter! brings to mind... the people of North Europe! 
-who are not Teddy's bears.
-Also. Thank you.
PS. So I had an experience, when I went along and spoke with someone- and the penny just dropped that whereas I'd spent my formative years at the cinema, he'd been doing some form of work. So. People just don't pick up my references. So this throws me into a quandary ... I think you have got to beware, that too many in-jokes spoil the universality of a piece. meaning, here- call the dog Chaplin, the couple's first dates are at an art-house cinema... That may well be a world the director feels comfortable in. (but if these characters are everymen everywomen everyperson, then not everyone goes to the cinema.) I loved the  deadpan humor in this film, along with the two quirky characters who just can't seem to stay employed. A strong undercurrent of barely expressed emotion and need for connection. It's visually gorgeous, every frame a treasure. It's not much of a secret that the worldview of Finnish society can be more than a little bleak. At the same time, though, it also possesses an understatedly campy, eminently whimsical quality that comes in stark contrast to this otherwise-dour outlook. And this makes for a combination of traits that can be somewhat puzzling to fathom, especially to outsiders. That's the quirky social conundrum that writer-director Aki Kaurismäki seeks to capture in his latest offering, a wry comedy-drama focused on the lives of two lonely, lovelorn working class Helsinki residents (Alma Pöysti, Jussi Vatanen) who struggle against life's hiccups while seeking to forge a romance. But, in telling their story, the filmmaker has difficulty finding sufficient traction to engage viewers. We witness a story full of modest, garden variety ups and downs, as well as more than a few miscommunications, experiences we've all no doubt undergone ourselves from time to time. However, is that enough to make a compelling picture? It certainly doesn't feel that way much of the time, given its wooden dialogue and restrained, sometimes-stilted performances, no matter how pointedly this production may portray the nature of this extraordinarily reserved people. To its credit, the film works best when it pokes fun at the nature of Finnish culture, providing some delicious nuggets of droll humor, backed by a diverse yet spot-on soundtrack that fittingly and ironically complements what's unfolding on screen. Nevertheless, there's so much here that lends so little to a narrative that just never catches fire that it's hard to imagine almost anyone generating any interest in, or enthusiasm for, the protagonists and their feeble attempts at launching a relationship. Maybe I'm missing something here, but, if there is something meaningful that this release is trying to convey, it's apparently well buried under one of those big piles of fallen leaves that give this picture its title. It's a strange movie. it has the feel of being amateur, but actually works. Many people have used the word quirky - it is. Everything is dull, the characters, weather and scenery. You don't feel you are looking at actors. But it keeps you smiling, and the music/songs are good. If it turns up on streaming, I'll watching it again.

 Remain Blessed and be updated, don't make the same mistake as I did. This movie was amazing. It has a short run time which is refreshing out alongside the other releases that consistently go above two hours. My whole theater was laughing at the dry pan humor and the out of time feel really made the movie very tense. It was a very enjoyable experience that will make you leave with a smile. Absolute masterpiece. Refined portray of real life and how tragic and comedic it can be. Oddball romantic deadpan comedy with nice cinematography. Slow paced but enough there to keep your interest throughout. It has a 90's look to it which I liked, overall I enjoyed it a lot! It's hard to imagine that this is a movie in 2023: except for the Russo-Ukrainian war on the radio, and the hard and hopeless life... The sadness and romance of middle-aged- lovers... Aki's cold humor and music taste are off the charts, comfortable and ironing . (There were many elderly audiences sitting in the old theater, and they laughed from time to time. Maybe the sense of the times in the film is the youth they are familiar with) A delight.  A deceptively simple piece of filmmaking featuring music to express the emotions of the comically taciturn would- be couple.  Among the treats is a Finnish version of Gordon Lightfoot's classic ""Early Morning Rain."" I love Aki Kaurismaki so I could be biased and guess what ... I loved the film. Classic Aki, if you are a fan you'll love it. Hilarious, unpredictable, deadpan. This is not an action film.  It is a beautifully rendered look at the mundane life of two characters we desperately hope will find each other.  And very subtly we see their characters change because, well, there now are reasons to change.  They embrace life very differently than before because of each other.  Beautiful film. ""Fallen Asleep"" would have been a better name for this one. Very slow paced. (And The NY Times review gave away anything that could have been mildly interesting.) Kaurismaki presents a succinct, drama-free depiction of the suffering, loneliness, alcoholism, and poverty of the Finnish working class. Static shots, laconic dialogue, chromatic expressiveness, and a marvelous selection of music from the 50s create the framework in which this love story unfolds, pierced by the news of the war in Ukraine, which, although synthetic and repetitive, nevertheless contains a rapturous emotionality. Fallen Leaves is perhaps Kaurismaki's toughest and shortest film, but also the most necessary in these times. Really enjoyable. A story about two people each living out their own rather bleak existence - but find hope and companionship with one another. The film is from Finland, so it has rather dark. sardonic humor and minimalist qualities. However, the actors are compelling to watch and the story is engaging. Lower class, industrial town with very few people to choose from to date, but a few middle aged couples do finally meet and match up.  Caim, gentle, uplifting, hopeful, and quiet film.  Few words, but much said. Not everyone lives on Park Avenue. For vierest new to Karausmääki Films this is a nice introduction. It doesn't add any new element to his previous films. (Variation of the usual story, greatly crafted pictures, desperate characters) However it's still a good one!"
Drama,the_marsh_kings_daughter,"The movie could have been a meaningful study of trauma. Instead, it gives in to the mechanics of a cat-and-mouse pursuit. For a while, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” feels as though it may be heading somewhere truly interesting, but, instead, it becomes a bit waterlogged. I was sitting back in my seat, nowhere near the edge of it. I would have liked to have inched towards the edge of it.  This is a very suspenseful film, at times unpleasantly so.  It's ironic that much of The Marsh King's Daughter takes place in a backwoods marsh area, because this entire movie is a soggy mess. It starts off as a monotonous drama and devolves into a series of silly action scenes that don't look believable. Ridley feels challenged in the right ways, while Mendelsohn channels another scummy character to strong effect. The stakes are just high enough to have kept me involved, and that’s fine for a decent paperback come-to-life situation. There’s nothing especially surprising about the way the film wraps up, but it still packs a mild punch, thanks to Ridley’s cold stare, borne of childhood trauma. A potent premise and earnest performances from Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are let down by an under-written screenplay that submits to the temptations of its genre. The tale is too tame, its savagery held too much in check to truly hold the audience in its thrall. It might make for a better book but The Marsh King’s Daughter is a stiff and stuffy thriller, lacking in a tighter script, and any true energy to dig itself out of the mud. While the premise of The Marsh King's Daughter is rich with the possibility for how introspectively deep the story could go, it doesn't manage to get there.  Rather than keeping us guessing or catching us by surprise, the movie goes the more conventional route, leading to an ending that's as far-fetched as it is predictable.  After a promising opening, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” quickly falls into a predictable and monotonous slog, plodding along toward an inevitable confrontation between father and daughter. On the positive side, the acting is good and the atmospheric setting is visually pleasing. Carried by a solid cast, The Marsh King’s Daughter tackles its intriguing premise in a competent fashion but never rises above the level of Lifetime thriller.
 For a thriller to work, you have to guess what's gonna happen, but the minute he [Mendelsohn] escapes from prison you just know exactly what's going to happen. This is a formulaic, predictable thriller.  It doesn’t take much of a survival instinct to sense that this should be avoided at all costs It's part psychological drama, part thriller, but not an effective whole. ... includes some on-the-nose dialogue for the more-than-capable cast. What starts as an atmospheric, introspective melodrama about fractured family bonds and primal instincts transitions into a formulaic cat-and-mouse saga about paranoia and past secrets.  While the opening and closing acts are strong, the middle section sags. Still, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” is a competent, unnerving thriller.","I kinda wish somebody other than the actors had read the book. Ben Mendelssohn has always been terrific. 'The Marsh King's Daughter' is an unfulfilling thriller that drowns in predictability and plodding. Good slow burner, enjoyable without being over the top. When a young girl learns that her life has been a lie, she grows up and puts to use the skills her father gave her in an attempt to save her new family The premise of a daddy's girl finding out that her mom was kidnapped and her woodsy life had been a lie is a great one. And when Mendelsohn comes back for her and her family years later, he's the perfect foe. But, the tension that could've been, just wasn't. Fantastic. Daisy is amazing. Fun suspense Thriller! My wife and I LOVED the movie! I'm absolutely dumbstruck by the number of negative reviews from the pros. The movie kept us on the verge of our seats most of the time. The plot was real, actors amazing (especially the two main characters), music on the money. We highly recommend it! A very engaging and hypnotic thriller. Neil Burger brings Karen Dionne's best-selling book to life through the great writing of Mark L. Smith and his daughter Elle Smith who together adapted this complex father daughter relationship. Daisy Ridley really comes into her own as one of our greatest actors and gives a powerful performance! Nearly a 40% difference from ""Critics"" to the average person.  Who even needs ""critics"" anyway. Dull and uninspiring. The cast isn't great either and there's just not much here to enjoy.  Times the story could have taken chances they just pushed through it. A trend a lot of modern writing has, bad. Gostei, tô querendo assistir esse filme! Gostei muito. Filme que prende você até o final Don't pay money to watch this. In fact, don't even watch it if someone pays you to. The premise is great but then it's absolutely trashed by a horrific plot progression that leads to one of the most unsatisfying conclusions imaginable. A filha do rei do pântano é uma excelente opção de vídeo para um final de semana. 👏🏽 Esse filme é muito bom Simplesmente perfeito A história não empolga, arrastando-se a partir do meio. Não há dúvida que a proposta era um trilhar que prende a atenção do telespectador, porém não cumpriu o que prometeu. Extremely bad pacing, I don't know if it's the director or editor. The acting wasn't very good either but I admit I watched this after a week of acclaimed films, so this movie paled in comparison. Garret Hedlund was good though. I wish he had more roles! Muito bom, excelente Interessante, recomendo. Os nervos ficam a flor da pele. Muito bom."
Drama,the_road_dance,"A serendipity of a movie with twists and turns I absolutely did not see coming. Essentially a period tearjerker about a woman’s resilience in the face of tragedy, but an evocative, emotionally effective one, anchored by a powerful lead performance by Hermione Corfield.  A small beauty, old-fashioned in emotion and technique, a pocket epic shot in the 4:3 Academy ratio of the earliest feature films. The storytelling is old-fashioned, but its raptures dear; the landscapes are timeless. Hopeful, it sweeps, even soars. Carrying most of the burden is Corfield, who is outstanding.  The actor channels Kirsty’s despair in a way that cuts straight to your heart. You simply can’t take your eyes off her, her conviction in the role a force to be reckoned with.  We’re left with the pretty scenery and a free-floating sense of inconsequentiality. Scottish Gothic-romantic entry boasts fine lead turn by Hermione Corfield and sweeping novelistic detail. Strong performances and striking visuals elevate this true-life Scottish melodrama above its narrative conventions. ... committed acting performances, particularly by the primary trio of Corfield, Morven Christie, and Ali Fumiko Whitney (the latter as Kirsty’s mother and sister), elevate this film far beyond what the rather mundane scripting gives them to work with. An old-fashioned melodrama, The Road Dance isn't quite up to the task of tackling the severity of the traumatic event at its core. The result has neither the full force of realism nor the emotional pleasures of melodrama; what it most calls to mind is something seen and half-forgotten on PBS. A vividly rendered, if ultimately schematic portrait of feminine resilience. “The Road Dance” is well worth a turn on the dance floor, delivering nicely on the time you invest in these characters and their situation. However, what unfolds in The Road Dance is an engaging, beautifully filmed, and intimately acted tale of trauma, grief, resilience, and hope. The commanding sense of place is most memorable in this naturalistic story of female bonding, a sweeping, sensitive melodrama about the consequences of a single violent act in a remote community … a handsome production that is striving for an emotionality that it cannot deliver because it fails to utterly commit to the protagonist. Photographed in the old-fashioned pre-wide-screen 3 x 4 ratio, the film is simple but, in its small way, quite memorable. The Road Dance is elevated by the simply stunning turns of both Fletcher and Corfield, the latter especially grand in the type of performance that feels as if we’re watching an actress just before she breaks through to public awareness. ... You can forgive the cliches because their implausibilities are overshadowed by the craggy grandeur of the island itself, with its huddled stone cottages and the closeness of those who dwell in them. The Road Dance is a sweeping epic of a type we don't see much of any more. …if you can handle the subject, then The Road Dance has enough good acting and narrative energy to make for a fairly gripping entertainment…","A gripping drama set in the pre WW1 period where young men and women were facing many terrors of war.  Entwined in that setting is a poignant story of a lovely young lady, in the prime of life, struck by love then loss.  The story was gripping.  The theme relates to many social questions today.  Not just a chick flick...I am an old man and enjoyed the movie tremendously. Beautiful film of love and tragedy in a small village in Scotland during the First World War. A must see for anyone who loves period films.  Stunning scenery and acting under the direction of Richie Adams. Very sad but ended very good. Great movie. There is no doubt... THE ROAD DANCE by Richie Adams is an instant cinema masterpiece! My wife and I laughed, cried, and mourned along with the characters as we sat spellbound by the finely tuned, smoothly unfolding epic story. Financers should be lining up to back Richie Adams next film! Clint and Lisa McCowen This movie was wonderful!  A touchingly beautiful tale.  The musical score and the photography was lovely!  A hidden gem! Absolutely brilliant. Engaging from start to finish with a proper sting in the tail. I love a movie like this that just draws you in and you are wondering each moment where it's leading. Beautifully filmed and acted. Captivating story with a few twists. If watching at home turn on the subtitles for several of the characters with heavy accents. Well worth watching in a theatre though given the incredible scenery. I thought the movie was really good and I loved watching it a cinephile's delight, intense story, sublime landscapes, a tour de force of reconstruction of the life of the perfect era, actors at the top
will certainly remain one of my pleasure cine films 2023 Very moving story. Makes excellent use of the local and coastal seascapes.
Watch for the human interaction. This isn't a historical-accurate film, but a human-story film.

Utterly outstanding performance by the lead actress. Amazing cinematography, setting and costumes let down by a loosely constructed storyline and ill-fitting script. This movie could have been so much better. Loved it. Very emotional. Great photography in a most interesting setting This was such a surprise - I watched it on a flight and I'm so glad I did! Not very uplifting. The characters didn't relate that well to each other. Gaps in the storyline and a glossy ending. I had wanted to like it, but it's not how it turned out. Beautifully crafted film that handles some quite difficult themes very well. Wonderful performances all round, especially by Hermione Corfield who is absolutely captivating in the lead role. Wow, what a wonderful heartfelt amazingly acted movie  just wow A solid, engaging and polished period drama that takes a heart-rending look at the victim of a terrible crime. The film is elevated by a devastating and riveting central performance by Hermione Corfield, who should be receiving many awards and wide acclaim for her work here. A simple but beautifully directed film - and a tragic one at times - but rewarding the patient and mature viewer looking for a film rich with character depth and human drama. Highly recommended. Already released in Scotland: went to see last night and felt it was an excellently filmed, well acted , well crafted and rounded story which engaged the viewer. An entirely believable tale over an enjoyable 2 hours. From my personal knowledge of living in Scotland and from anecdotes told over my life by older relatives / friends it appears to give a reasonably acurate view of life in 1910's Scotland - visually, emotionally and culturally. You could do far worse than watch this one. A big story about small lives and emotional dilemmas and attitudes. A beautiful film for the eye and soul"
Drama,the_three_musketeers_part_i_dartagnan,"Though one can question some of the filmmakers’ decisions, generally they pull off the attempt to revivify Dumas’ flavorful swashbuckler for modern audiences.  It is romantic in the classic sense of the word. These characters have values, and although the film is frequently funny, it never sneers at honor or chivalry. When Athos announces he would rather die than betray his King, we believe him.  D’Artagnan proves itself a highly worthy contestant amongst its predecessors, shining with exemplary visual craft, writing and acting. What this installment energetically proves is that you can ruffle the feathers of a totemic tale and still capture what’s good, galloping fun in Dumas’ storytelling. THE THREE MUSKETEERS: D’ARTAGNAN tells the first half of the story, and is the first from France in decades, filled with sword fights and palace intrigue, but never losing sight of the characters amidst all of the swashbuckling. Dumas was a master of the serial form, and this version of “The Three Musketeers” manages to preserve that thrill-to-thrill sensation. Slick and stylish, this latest cinematic adaptation of the venerable adventure saga hardly breaks any new ground, but it showcases a strong cast and some exciting action sequences. It helps that the cast is excellent, the production design exquisite, and the camera appropriately frenetic. These musketeers have panache, and I am all here for it. ...a real old-fashioned swashbuckler, full of sword fights, handsome men and pretty ladies, improbably accurate gunplay (with smoothbore weapons!), stunning locations, candlelit interiors, wild stunts... The machinations of the French court, its enemies and protectors, wide network of spies and the Three Musketeers’ derring-do bring Dumas’ novel to vivid life.
 The Three Musketeers: Part I – D'Artagnan recalls a different, older type of filmmaking, and it's fun and exciting, too. The production values are exquisite, the cinematography gorgeous and the fighting sequences exciting. It’s on a par with Richard Lester’s 1972 version, and that is saying something. There’s no place for camp in this film. Maybe it’s that it’s presented in French, the original novel’s mother tongue, but this is an honouring tale that gives new life to the classic story, and a more elevated version of D'Artagnan.  Well-produced, mildly engaging and occasionally thrilling, but undercooked and overstuffed. It's lucky to have a fine ensemble cast. Wielding the perfect balance between classic storytelling and refreshing execution, the film -elevated by wickedly fun performances- is evocative and entertaining. Fans of medieval adventures, this one is for all of you! [Full Review in Spanish] This version of the story has a few funny moments, but plays things straight and still manages to be a rewarding and enjoyable remake...Maybe they’ll find more of the “fun” in the second half/”sequel.” Director Martin Bourboulon takes viewers to the early 17th century and inserts them into Alexandre Dumas' classic novel like no one has before.  If all you want from a ""Three Musketeers"" tale is action and adventure, you’re going to get all you can handle and more in Bourboulon’s ""D’Artagnan."" An attractively shot, muscular adventure film, with a rock-solid cast, rich production values, and a charming frisson of authenticity. An eminent cast engages in duels of swords and the heart across a film that is giddy fun from start to finish.","A pesar de que Los Tres Mosqueteros ya tiene demasiadas adaptaciones, sorprendentemente esta producción francesa ofrece algo que, a diferencia de las adaptaciones anteriores, se aferra bastante a la novela en muchos aspectos. Es una película excelente en mucos aspectos técnicos con una estupenda producción. Cuenta con un buen elenco y el guion ofrece una trama mucho más detallada de Los Tres Mosqueteros. Athos acusado de un crimen que no cometió, el romance oculto entre Buckingham y Ana, los protestantes, elementos históricos del conflicto entre Francia e Inglaterra y una pista sobre el pasado de Milady son detalles que ayudan bastante a la dinámica de la trama. Es una historia clásica de acción y aventura muy bien ejecutada y adaptada a los tiempos actuales. Al igual que las primeras adaptaciones, esta película solo narra la mitad de la novela y lo hace de una manera espectacular. Les Trois Mousquetaires: D'Artagnan es quizás la adaptación definitiva de la obra de Dumas y deja una muy buena impresión con deseos de ver el resto de la historia en la segunda parte. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10. What makes this adaptation of the work of Alexandre Dumas different is that it is more faithful to the original idea, due to its solemn style, without the classic formula of swordsman cinema. That makes it an object of curiosity, especially because of the imminent chapters. D'Artagnan é um jovem gascão que quer se tornar um mosqueteiro real. Porém, logo que chega a Paris, ele interfere em um ataque é quase morto e enterrado. De volta a Paris, ele inicia uma amizade com os famosos Três Mosqueteiros (Aramis, Athos e Porthos), ao mesmo tempo, que se vê envolvido em uma série de traições e golpes contra o Rei da França, Luis XIII. O filme é a primeira parte de uma aventura que adapta o clássico de Alexandre Dumas, inúmeras vezes já feito para o cinema. O filme tem uma boa direção de arte e figurino. O roteiro é bem fiel ao livro, tomando algum liberdades, como tornar Porthos bissexual. O elenco é muito bom, com destaque para Eva Green como a ardilosa Milady, nome pela qual não é denominada em nenhum momento do filme. Não há grandes novidades, mas apenas um bom filme de aventuras, de capa e espada para nos divertir. A well-made classic story, good camera and set design. If you've read the book and still like this movie you must have superbly low expectations. What is the point of adapting a novel if you're gonna make up 70% of the plot? Are the writers smarter than Dumas? They apparently think they can write something better than a classic beloved by many generations.

The characters are too old - yes I'm agist, sue me. Athos, a character only slightly older than the rest of the musketeers, but still a man in his prime, is here a grandpa. Eva Green looks like she could be his daughter, not ex-wife. Speaking of which, although she is an amazing actress - also too old for Mylady, which according to the books is only around 27. Also she is just this menacing unknown entity doing the dirty work for the cardinal and lacking the sophistication and aristocratic standing from the books - we don't even get to know her as Mylady Winter. There is huge plotline in the book which centers around her being a ""Winter"" and her brother-in-law. She is also capable of being extremely charming, yet devious - something we can see only in one short scene with D'Artagnan (im which she has the blonde wig on). 

Aramis was torturing someone with a cross - what the hell is that?? He is a man of God, yes not a perfect one, but Aramis from the book would NEVER behave in such a way. 

Porthos is bisexual (??) and they act as if it were normal. I highly doubt that 16th century catholic France would be so LGBT friendly. If they want a modern movie they should adapt a book that was written in the last 30 years.

D'Artagnan, a shrewd and capable character in the books, is here just a guy who is very lucky (survives bullets like Superman). 

Constance is a good character, although I would've liked an actress with blonde hair, for her as well as for Mylady Winter. The juxtaposition of these two women who both look innocent and like angels, whereas one is just the opposite of it, makes their encounter in the monastery towards the end of the book that much more interesting.

I don't know, I just expected a lot more from this French adaptation. The visuals, sets and costumes are nice, and that is the only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 stars. Bom filme, apesar de utilizarem o personagem Porthos para agradar aos Wokes, estou aguardando a última parte. Recomendo! 'The Three Musketeers: D'Artagnan' is a lavish enjoyable historical romp with tons of swash-buckling action. This movie has it's own heart, A brilliant adaptation of Alexandre Dumas, Defenetly one that You don't want to miss Overly frenetic camerawork aside, this is a well paced period swashbuckler and a lot of fun. Que nostalgia assistir os 3 mosqueteiros, é um bom filme com alta qualidade em cenários de época , apesar de ter também uma boa história, há alguns furos que me incomodaram, tipo a mulher rouba um colar da pra D'Artagnan e depois se joga no precipício com mar lá embaixo, se a intenção era fazer a guerra, porque ela já que ia se jogar, porque não levou o colar junto? A missão dela estava cumprida! Kkkk… lembro de ter a mesma sensação em mais duas cenas, mas enfim, o filme é bom! its a great movie in general, a great diferencial i think is to put all the conversation betwin frensh caracters in french, a lot a movies put the conversarion betwin a foreigner caracters in english, this make the movie worst in my opinion. Very good movie unlike the woke madness that has taken over Hollywood.i used to think that European movies are for the weird tastes but after what happened in the US i ended up with nothing to see all until i started watching European cinema thank God you are here to save us.Very nice script i liked the acting the atmosphere was great the scenery and the outshooting was amazing i have nothing to say expect good job and that i am very happy that there are still countries that are able to produce great movies without any of the political correctness madness.I see great future in the European Cinema his horse should be the colour of butter or yellow at least, it was one of the reasons for the insults he received.
C'mon you couldn't find a Bearn pony?! A brillant take on the masterpiece of Dumas ! Actors are Amazing, the directing is immersive, the music wonderful and the dialog are magnificent ! Excellent adaptation of the famous romantic novel written by Dumas. Great cast, efficient plot, sober acting. A must see, before the second part. At last a reboot, that doesn't kill its original story. A very good movie with a brillant cast ! I Hope many people will go see it when it release in the US ! The best adaptation of the three musketeers ! At least ! A real French badass movie without woke treatment. An astonishing moment, a must see !... VIVE LE ROI ! Fantastic, great story. 
The fight scenes were amazing, the camera seemed to be in the rough and tumble and chaos, never seen anything like it. Le premier opus de cette reprise est une réussite. Des prises de caméra qui vous plongent dans l'action directement au côté des protagonistes, une bande son excellente qui rappelle un mélange de Pirates de Caraïbes et Sherlock Holmes (celui de Guy Ritchie), des costumes sublimes... Le scénario est simple, efficace et avec des rebondissements bien rythmés qui nous entraînent d'une péripétie à l'autre avec fluidite sans nous déboussoler : pause lors des manigances politiques, puis action, enquête, infiltrations et combats. C'est une vrai épopée de capes et d'épée comme on en voulait, avec un rythme moderne et des acteurs qui jouent correctement. Eva Green, égale à elle-même, apporte une grâce et un côté femme fatal parfait pour son rôle. D'Artagnan est attachant, et les scènes romantiques dégagent une vrai émotion, et un vrai réalisme. Nous ne connaissons pas encore tous les personnages en profondeur, mais chacun porte et dégage une identité qui le rend vivant sans entacher le scénario, ce qui nous permet en tant que spectateurs de les ajouter facilement au tableau global de la scène tout en restant concentrés sur les enjeux de la trame narrative. Un film que je vais revoir plusieurs fois avec plaisir et qui est sans l'ombre d'un doute devenu un classique du genre. A voir au cinéma, pour être plongé dans l'ambiance ! Hâte de voir le deuxième volet en salle cet hiver."
Drama,the_end_we_start_from," Comer has pretty much proven that she can play any kind of role and do it masterfully, carrying this film almost entirely on her sturdy shoulders. Yet in among this unforgiving environment is a story of hope, perseverance, and courage embodied by the incredible Comer, who was so brilliant in TV's Killing Eve. The End We Start From leaves most of its spectacle to the imagination, freeing Belo to train her camera on the whirlwind of emotions that storm across Comer’s face. “The End We Start From” is an anxiety-inducing experience, not due to loud explosions or effects-driven set pieces, but due to things that feel real and grounded in truthful observations. It's a solid story that looks and sounds great, but I wouldn't be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion that's ravaging Mom's heart. [T]he third act of The End We Start From is underwhelming, compared to the rising human and survivalist drama that makes the first two acts compelling... The End We Start From isn’t a big, blockbuster disaster movie. It’s quiet and sometimes still and it asks you to think about our existence. But it’s also meaningful, finding unlikely splendor in the midst of destruction. THE END WE START FROM is a dramatic thriller driven by the outstanding performance from Comer.  THE END WE START FROM is an impressive beginning for Belo as a new filmmaker. And it does add to the already extraordinary resume that is Comer’s.  An engrossing, tender and refreshingly nuanced emotional journey. Jodi Comer gives a radiant and raw performance.  In more ways than one, the film comes off like “A Quiet Place Part II” without the scary creatures. If you liked Children of Men, chances are you will enjoy this film. It has the same blend of despondency and lyricism, hope and despair, beauty and violence. While Jodie Comer leads the movie with a committed, subdued and surprising performance, it’s not enough to keep this sparse movie afloat. Bolstered by Jodie Comer’s fantastic leading performance, Mahalia Belo’s The End We Start From is a powerful debut that delivers a thoughtful approach to the end of the world. The End We Start From falls short of being a meaningful observation on the perils of climate injustice, but the film succeeds as an embodiment of maternal commitment, largely due to Comer’s wonderfully present performance. Mahalia Belo’s The End We Start From sees Emmy-winning Jodie Comer navigate a story as muddy as the flooded grounds of Hyde Park in a post-apocalyptic drama that fails to nail the human connection at its core. While the film itself isn’t distinctive enough to make a big splash, it’s yet more evidence that it’s only a matter of time before Comer is the A lister she deserves to be. If not quite as strong as something like Children of Men, The End We Start From is an impressive debut feature with a strong cast anchored by a stellar lead performance from Jodie Comer. The slow buildup of tension shows the horror of the situation.

 This bittersweet elegy for our society—and its optimistic notion that we still have time to rebuild—is adrift in a narrative that finds itself sunk beneath its cataclysmic peers in the genre. The End We Start From explores more than motherhood at the end of the world, its subject is every nuance of womanhood at any stage of life. ",A poignant and riveting post apocalyptic thriller. Jodie comers performance alone is worth the watch. Profoundly English & an extremely meditative study of the primal essence of protecting one’s child.
Drama,the_persian_version,"Girls succeed, and fun remains the operating mood for The Persian Version movie. A vibrant comedy that perfectly balances the film’s dramatic overtone with continuous pockets of levity. It’s a story of determination and independence, filled with headstrong female characters overcoming misogynistic prejudice. It's also a lot of fun Though Leila is an engaging and sympathetic character, Shireen’s saga is the more engrossing as she ascends from child bride to enterprising businesswoman and champion to immigrants trying to achieve the American dream.  Once you get past the feeling of wanting more, The Persian Version is a heartwarming -- and often heartbreaking -- exploration of a mother and daughter repairing their future relationship by confronting their past. You can admire writer-director Maryam Keshavarz’s   ambition, but the effect is like watching a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air at once. Filled with laughter, heart, and excellent work from Layla Mohammadi and Niousha Noor, The Persian Version is a delight to watch. ... recombines familiar themes into a fresh and vibrant package that manages a heartfelt mix of humor and sentiment. A filmmaker who has been around for more than a decade suddenly establishes herself as a bold new comic voice in The Persian Version. I’d welcome more of this (and some more filmmaking discipline) from her and her leading lady. Too many shifts in times, tones, and ideas crowd the earnest intentions. A comedy in bold, candied colors and spirited performances, Maryam Keshavarz’s <I>The Persian Version</I> sings, zings and even stings with cultural specificity... Madcap dashes... rise above the potent danger for a descent into therapeutic digression.  One of the year’s most surprisingly potent small discoveries. Even though some of the characters are thinly developed, the film ends on a touching high note that helps to alleviate some of the overarching shortcomings. The result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals. [But,] while a good time was had, I can't shake the sense that there was potential for so much more. Though light-hearted, The Persian Version deals with serious issues pertaining to fragmented cultural identity and generational disconnection. Keshavarz hopscotches through numerous genres to relate this feisty feminist tale, and those tonal shifts can be jarring. But the payoff, including a couple of dance numbers, is worth enduring a few bumps in the road.  The Persian Version goes beyond its title to be a universal yet specific story for immigrants everywhere. You’ll be equal parts laughing and crying throughout.

 Yet despite its flaws, The Persian Version is engaging and fresh. With Keshavarz at the helm, the movie is simultaneously familiar and unexpected, and its joyful approach will draw the audience into what may be an unfamiliar world for some.  The Persian Version remains an impassioned piece of work that sets Kezhavarz, Mohammadi, and Noor as ones to watch if you weren’t paying attention to their work before. ...a mostly interminable comedy that remains hopelessly unable to capture the viewer’s interest and attention (even fleetingly)... Maryam Keshavarz’s semi-autobiographical film paints a colorful portrait of an Iranian American family that crosses borders and timelines.","An interesting, complicated, and funny story of an immigrant family's generational struggle to leave Iran and make it in America told with a good soundtrack and the occasional dance scene. just an awesome movie ... What a great movie! I just finished it and honesty I'm so impressed by the original story of it. My Iranian heart can't be more emotional tonight. Shout out to all the casts amd whoever was involved in making this lovely piece of art. Absolutely hilarious. Loved it. At the beginning it seems a classical politically correct movie, but soon we discover a real life story who makes us laugh and cry in the same time. To movie is very good and the story too. Even the soundtrack makes a great job on it. I really enjoyed and all the characters (there are alot) are remarkable. Molto bello! Great directing, excellent acting and overall a perfect comedy yet a tear jerker. I am Persian and have lived most of my life in Iran. This movie doesn't come close to capturing the essence of Persian culture. The portrayal of life in Iran, both now and in the past, doesn't align with reality. The actors, their attire, the movie's settings, and the cultural references are far from accurate representations of Iran and Iranians. In terms of the film itself, there are numerous issues. For instance, Sheerin (the mom) undergoes drastic changes in skin color and eye color when depicted at a younger age, lacking any resemblance to her older self. Overall, this movie falls significantly below average. How refreshing to see a film by  Iranian-American Artists!!! I loved how the film spanned over three generations: from the small country village of the grandmother, to the American city of the newly arrived immigrant mother, and finally, the modern day American culture of the granddaughter.  The film hits hard at first with a look at the youngest of the three females, whose lifestyle is difficult for her mother to swallow.  Interestingly the grandmother, perhaps having grown more accepting and wiser over the years, has a closer connection to her granddaughter. As the story progresses, the youngest learns the background story of her mother, who it turns out,  is probably the biggest heroine of the three, despite her stoic demeanor.  The end of this movie had me in tears.  It was a wonderful, moving narrative about culture, realized and unrealized dreams, fortitude, family, judgement, and most importantly, LOVE. Very well put together lively entertaining and culturally informative. Would like to see more Iranian American films. 

I liked the actress who played the grandmother had me laughing hysterically! 

The American drag queen character played his part brilliantly!                                                

This a movie that I recommended to all my friends and family.

It is a movie for baby boomers, and millennials, and generation Z.

Every Iranian American will find something to relate to.

I sincerely hope that this is just a beginning of this talented Iranian writer's career.

I hope to see the Iranian director and writer produce more movies of this bicultural genre. Story was well written. Pacing was great and the film really kept me engaged to the screen. One of the best films Ive seen all year. Very amazing how the Persians are so similar to many immigrant success stories of different ethnicities. The way in which this movie moves through generations of women and balances trauma with comedy is absolutely incredible. You will laugh and cry and feel like you're with your family. Amazing to see Irooni representation like this. TRAILBLAZER! Abundantly bold and revolutionary in its storytelling! This film and its protagonist are what we need as a society to break out of the idea that immigrant stories need to be confined to the linear (and often lying) narrative of The American Dream. Leila, our hero, ceases to give up control by relentlessly championing her own story through writing herself into the narrative, front and center. We traverse through time with her as she makes real time discoveries of who she is, where she came from, and the power of her lineage. As a result, the storyline with her mother is written with an unflinching reverence and tenderness. This film will make you laugh, cry, and experience a rollercoaster of emotions as it shows you a pathway to healing and what it means for a family to break the cycles of intergenerational trauma. A film that we all need to see. I urge you to go see this film. I've been raving all weekend. The best film I've seen all year. I have never felt so seen, so moved, and so encaptured by a plot line and a cast. I cried tears of belonging and understanding. I softly hummed to the songs and dances of nostalgia. Maryam and her team so beautifully captured her family's story, and in doing so, illustrated the texture and depth of the Iranian and immigrant story in the US. The trailer only shows a sliver of the film -- there was so much depth and creativity in the storytelling. I don't want to reveal more, but go see The Persian Version, once with your girlfriends, once with your Iranian and non-Iranian partners, and once with your maman and mamanbozorg (half of the film is in Farsi). You'll get so much out of watching each time. I enjoyed the movie for highlighting the cultural differences between the US and Iran/ Persia. The movie was at once funny and serious, very moving. As an Iranian-American who grew up in the US, ""The Persian Version"" is a mirror reflecting the nuances of my own life.  Watching Leila's journey was like walking through my own memories. The film's portrayal of growing up in the US with Iranian roots resonated deeply with me, bringing forth emotions and memories I hadn't fully understood until now.

Leila's struggles, her efforts to balance her dual heritage, and her navigation through the complexities of family dynamics are not just cinematic elements; they are lived experiences for many, including myself. As the only queer daughter in my family, the film's exploration of patriarchy and familial expectations struck a particularly personal chord. It validated my experiences in ways that are hard to articulate.

The film is beautifully layered—funny yet poignant, light-hearted yet deeply touching.  
It captures the vibrancy and beauty of Iranian culture, and the essence of being caught between two worlds. The stories of Leila's mother and grandmother were especially moving. They shed light on the resilience of our ancestors, making me realize how little we often know about their struggles. This realization fostered a newfound empathy for my forebears and a sense of pride in my heritage.

""The Persian Version"" is a film that has helped me piece together parts of my past, understand my history better, and feel less alone in my journey. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Maryam Keshavarz for making a film that not only entertains but also heals and enlightens. It's a rare gem! We really enjoyed the story line and how it all came together at the end! The actress portraying Leila did an amazing job! Will definitely recommend it to friends! I laughed and cried in this movie!
Great story telling and funny characters. This movie innovates many artistic elements including concise subtitles, disarming humor in two languages, emotional depth, unexpected plot twists and cultural commentary. Anyone with an ethnic family can relate to this. It's like the modern My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Love Laylas spot on narration and take on modern day relationships versus traditional family traditions. One of the most delightful Persian movies I have seen so far. No matter what  the ethnicity or culture,  there is something in this movie for everyone. Excellent storytelling.!!"
