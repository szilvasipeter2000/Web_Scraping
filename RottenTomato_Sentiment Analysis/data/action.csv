Action,godzilla_minus_one,"The technical quality of the effects is great. So, happily, is the artistic quality. Takashi Yamasaki‚Äôs Godzilla Minus One returns to the roots of the origin story with essential drama that gives weight to the monstrous spectacle. To really sink into the movie is to hold yourself in a state suspended between reality and surreality. Task-oriented plot mechanics exist next to veiled references to Shintoism, and it all blends perfectly... Overall, Godzilla Minus One is a grand creature feature that that bellows and stomps on its competition with its compelling humanist core, awe-inspiring spectacle and its grounded approach to its characters. Every generation gets the Godzilla they both need and deserve, and the most recent iteration doesn‚Äôt miss. You definitely feel for all these characters and and the choices that they make, and that adds a surprising amount of like emotional heft to what could have just been a thrilling but a purely exciting escapist action film. Director Takashi Yamazaki captures the essence of the traditional MonsterVerse and elevates it to a monumental new level, resulting in the best Godzilla film in decades. [Full Review in Spanish] This really shows Hollywood how it's done. Godzilla Minus One delivers a disaster epic worthy of the character‚Äôs legacy. Godzilla Minus One‚Äôs opening moments feature some of the most impressively visceral Godzilla action in recent years. If Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters left you wanting more Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One scratches that itch and then some.  Has a much better grasp of both storytelling and action filmmaking than probably 95 percent of what Hollywood has been churning out lately Godzilla Minus One is a breathtaking tour-de-force for the power of cinema itself, a much-needed reminder of how good it feels to sit in a movie theater when studios actually invest in work that respects the humanity of its audience. Action trumps meaning and symbolism, but it's still a rollicking ol' time. It puts the trauma of history at the very centre of the story, ultimately crafting a story about human beings pulling together to heal and defeat an inexplicable force of destruction. Godzilla Minus One is not only one of the best films out of the 30-plus in the series, but also one of the best films of the year. The acting is superb, the destruction is immense and incredible, and the gnarly Godzilla design is fantastic. Mercifully, the film takes a light-touch approach to using its star as an off-the-peg allegory for processing historical trauma, delivering instead blockbuster thrills... The best fantasy action film of the year. Yamazaki‚Äôs film is an artful, bar-setting, barrier-shattering, near masterpiece in the guise of a behemoth blockbuster. Godzilla Minus One is one of the strongest blockbusters of 2023, a movie I could see easily smashing its way onto my best of the year list.  ... organic, heartbreaking, and cheer-worthy... an unholy marriage between Dunkirk and Jaws served up with a side of raw courage... incredible film in addition to being a great Godzilla movie.","Excellent movie, best Godzilla movie I've seen. THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME Only downfall was that it's in Japanese!  Great movie BanzaiÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ I am a HUGE Godzilla fan. The creature was amazing and, hes not the good monster any more. Th storyline was so different and done so well. Highly recommend. Welll it was one of the greatest Japanese movie ever. And the ending twist was shocking and apparently  it's not over since they show at the end that he's still alive for a sequel Easily worth the price of admission. You have excellently written characters with actual arcs that you come to enjoy and root for. That being said the second half of the movie does drag just a bit. The finale however does make it worth it. Fantastic Movie! Great story and well balanced, not too much screen time for Godzilla and not too much Screen Time of characters! Loved how they kept the feel of the original feel of Godzilla Great movie. It's more about how hard it was for the people in this community struggled post World War, then they had to deal with an additional problem of Godzilla. It's also a story about the main character's journey for redemption. Highly recommended. What I liked about the movie is when they created a plan to kill Godzilla and it worked and also at the start when it said in 1945 it reminded me of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the bombings and it was tragic especially after the bombings you have to face another threat which was Godzilla and I thought it was sad when buildings were destroyed and they had to keep rebuilding. Best movie I have seen all year! The story, characters, themes, and Godzilla itself was great. I am so happy I decided to watch the movie with my friends. 

If you have not watched, I highly recommend you go watch it!! While most Godzilla movies can suffer from it's human cast, Minus One thrives because of them. NOT inspite of them. The themes that created the beloved kaiju are back and come with a bigger gut punch than ever. This is a can't miss for anyone that's a fan of the King of Monsters A so adaptation that has been a masterpiece sense it's release with great acting and crafting of Godzilla this is one of the better Godzilla films ever made I appreciate it a lot. um filme imperd√≠vel para assistir no final de semana um prato pra quem e f√£ do rei dos monstros ‚ô•Ô∏è obrigado toyo a produtora do filme por fazer esse filme maravilhoso me emocionei no final do filme e minha nota para esse √© 10/10 ent√£o resumindo tudo v√° assistir o filme recomendo muito ‚ô•Ô∏èüëëviva ao rei dos monstros (desculpa pelo texto longo) We definitely need more films that aren't made in Hollywood. Japan and South Korea truly are leading the way both in films and TV shows. A new beginning indeed.
Great film by the way!. My god, you get Godzilla 2 hours long AND a good story with great actors. The setting right after world war 2 was alsof a great idea. I LOVED this. Thank you Yamazaki-san. An outstanding post war drama hidden within an amazing Godzilla film. He's terrifying from the 1st appearance by the way. I'll delve no further as to not ruin it. Just go watch it. Easy the best Godzilla film in decades! Compelling character story lines and jaw dropping Kaiju destruction made for a truly captivating movie. Kariko was adorable too! Much better than expected. Godzilla was awesome"
Action,napoleon_2023,"It‚Äôs one thing for a movie to not care for human insight. It‚Äôs another for it to fail to engage with conflict in any meaningful way, inside or out. It‚Äôs clear, I think, that in spite of various attempts to make Napoleon work as a biopic, the film doesn‚Äôt have a bio. It has a general of genius, something like a sports figure who is alive only in games or tournaments. Epic battle scenes but the personal story is lacking. It feels as if Scott is flipping the bird to a film industry that takes itself too seriously. Known for his prowess in historical dramas, Scott's latest endeavor falls short in grasping the complexity of Napoleon's rise and fall. The film is visually impressive, but it is not emotionally stirring. The heart of it was not as exciting as it could be in terms of the emotions. I have mixed feelings on this film.   While there's no immediate lesson to be found in ""Napoleon,"" one might yet be found in director Scott's upcoming 4-hour version. I'd recommend waiting. It‚Äôs definitely not your typical portrayal of a famous historical figure, and the better for it. You‚Äôre not going to have a complete picture of the events that comprised Napoleon‚Äôs life, but you might just have a better understanding of who the man was and why we‚Äôre still so fascinated by him over two centuries after his death. I don't want to assume anything yet, but you can't help but wonder given the editing here that this might be another KINGDOM OF HEAVEN situation.  It doesn‚Äôt really take a historian to appreciate that a lot of liberty‚Äôs have been taken here. Equally, it doesn‚Äôt take a psychiatrist to know that Scott barely scratches the surface of Napoleon‚Äôs psyche. [Joaquin] Phoenix's penchant for dry, understated performances turns this one into a downright comedy, a Wes Anderson character study trapped in a Steven Spielberg period drama ... Where does Napoleon start when Phoenix never seems to end? War is hell, of course, in Ridley Scott‚Äôs biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte. But for viewers of this film, safe in their cinema seats, it is also inescapably magnificent. Napoleon offers so much. And yet it leaves us wanting more. Despite all the history, the battles and the politics, this movie stays on track as a personal story. This makes Napoleon and Josephine characters in the story who are easy to relate to, as well as being a strong focal point for the film. It is fascinating watching Phoenix play Bonaparte like he's a gamer who's constantly on the verge of rage quitting. Ridley Scott's newest film, Napoleon, suffers in its storytelling from the many historical inaccuracies that plague the picture. The mediocrity of the film does not reside in the distance from the character who supposedly inspires it, but in the lack of narrative progression and the lack of depth it reaches. [Full review in Spanish] Napoleon paints a pleasingly knotty, often unflattering portrait of its protagonist (who is shown as shrewd in battle, vulnerable in love and socially ill at ease), and is full of quirky, often humorous details and dialogue to savour. Mr. Phoenix's Napoleon could never have commanded so much as a squadron of the Salvation Army, and though the movie is sprinkled with a few reasonably hearty battle scenes, overall it's something like Mr. Scott's Waterloo.","Very well told story, excellent acting and outstanding soundtrack! Joachim Phoenix was terrific as Napoleon, having just the right amount of audacity and attitude.  Though historical liberties may have been taken, the movie was riveting and kept my family thoroughly engaged. The special effects were amazing and convincing. Jaquin is an amazing actor, but the rest was pretty lame. Napoleon in the Marvel Universe

Save your money and watch it on TV
Someone may even like the movie, but the movie is bad. See that they are different things
Whoever found a good movie, maybe they should do an urgent skull scan

The movie doesn't work, it has no plot, it has no context, it seems like it's a collage of scenes independent of each other

In the end, the feeling is of waste. A gigantic production, excellent costumes, well-produced battles (from a visual point of view)

To get out a mambembe and clich√© thing. It's almost like Napoleon in the Marvel Universe, leading a cavalry charge in the middle of the battle of Waterloo

- If you want to be kind to Ridley Scott, although I don't think he deserves it, because he is very arrogant, he was a victim Of the magnitude of the story I wanted to tell, condensing 25 years of events in 160 minutes. It didn't work and it got worse, which would already be difficult

- This is remarkable in the film's omissions. The film simply EVEN MENTIONS Spain, the battle of Trafalgar, Ney or Murat It was the worst movie I have seen in years! Dont bother spending the money. Long drawn out babble.  Not to mention inappropriate sexual scenes that were not necessary.  The dialogue was terrible, difficult to hear and looooong! Not a historical epic or a perverse love story. Yuck. Overall it was a good movie, not great but solid.  Focused too much on his love life with Josephine and not his genius battle techniques and ways of conquering.  Would have liked to seen more battle scenes and more strategic planning for war, Joaquin Phoenix did a good job playing Napoleon but I expected a more serious tone from him, after all Napoleon did almost conquer everything! Slow moving, boring.  My wife fell asleep.  Mis casting of Napoleon.  He was terrible. Very slow and seemed to focus on his relationship with Josephine more than I expected.  Would‚Äôve liked to have seen more of his conquests. Fantastic movie with some amazing battle scenes. Excellent performance from JP who played the part of nepoleon very well. Me and the missus were hooked from start to finish! It fails to tell a compelling story. The film is mostly concentrated on a few nice war scenes and Napoleon's sex life. Seems to me like Ridley Scott didn't care to make a movie about a French emperor who led one of the most successful empires in history. Instead I was forced to watch an uncomfortable 2+ hour porn film about a sensitive sex addict. How do we go from Blade Runner to this garbage? 

Truly disappointed.

Truly disappointed Only Hollywood bs, a mockery of history, a mockery of a movie and a mockery of my time No character development, no cohesion in the story and no drama anywhere in the movie. The few battle scenes are interesting and well made but there's plenty of other movies where that's the case. Let's not even talk about historical inaccuracies. Feels more like the director was mad at the French and just made a cheap hit peace. Maybe he got rejected by a French girl once NAPOLEON 
For a film where the protagonist has the word ""boner"" in his name, this is the flop of the year.
Very disappointing as Scott and Phoenix are masters of their craft, however it lacked their usual cutting edge.
There was hardly a French word spoken and not even an attempt to incorporate an accent by any of the cast. 
It felt like a ""rom-com"" where they wanted to cast the Joker for this role, not Phoenix. 
It lacked any build up to the major historical events of the time and what should/could have been a historical epic masterpiece was instead an epic fail. Movie is like reading the extreme cliff notes version on Napoleon with glossing over so many important events and played by an actor a bit too old for the part. This is one of Ridley Scott‚Äôs less impressive films. A historic look at Napoleon Bonaparte, I am a history buff & I did enjoy learning more about the General, but there were times I wasn't clear on the plot at hand on the screen. 
If you don't like history I would not advise watching because I like history & places confused me about what was occuring. Very interesting about him with his rise and fall. I did learn quite a bit about him ego and personality. Horrible boring movie. Left before it was over. Had so much potential and they dropped the ball Less war and more creepy love story than we expected. The story was very interesting, the actions did an excellent job."
Action,the_hunger_games_the_ballad_of_songbirds_and_snakes,"Set sixty-four years before the triumph of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the clever screenplay reflects the violence assimilated by the culture. [Full Review in Spanish] The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is more focused on delivering Easter eggs with the subtlety of a sledgehammer than developing these characters. It leaves us with nearly three hours of brand revival. The fun performances by a game cast can't make up for poor pacing and a bloated runtime that feels wholly unearned. It‚Äôs still just a slightly modernized, teen-oriented take on ""Rollerball"" or ‚ÄúThe Running Man.‚Äù THE HUNGER GAMES: THE BALLAD OF SONGBIRDS AND SNAKES is an incredible extension of the series, both in terms of structure and theme. A reasonably compelling narrative about a conflicted young man, a man torn between his ambitious nature and his moral compass and feelings for a charming and beautiful young woman. [R]evisiting the original series‚Äô ideas and themes leads to diminishing dramatic and emotional returns, but as a case study in authoritarian politics, [this film] remains as relevant today as it was fifteen years ago when the first novel was published. An entertaining installment that may not be quite as good as the originals, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes definitely stands on its own merits and charm. Were we champing at the bit to learn how Donald Sutherland‚Äôs Machiavellian President Coriolanus Snow schemed his way to power in the years before the original The Hunger Games Needs no more installments. Years after the young-adult dystopia genre crested and flattened, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is here to remind us of what we are missing: not much. The best film in the series ‚Äî but that‚Äôs still not saying much. The action scenes remain well-shot and tightly edited, and even without the provocative political energy of the Katniss years, the cultural parallels between Panem‚Äôs world and ours retain their unsettling power. ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a film of contrasts ‚Äî visually stunning yet narratively uneven, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the origins of Panem, but not without stumbling over its own ambitious intentions. I do not buy it philosophically for one second. It is very long and sometimes unwieldy, but in the hands of director Francis Lawrence... I think fans will like it. It delivers mostly the high notes you expect from a film of this sort. A standout leading lady isn't quite enough to rescue Songbirds and Snakes from sluggish runtime, bizarre pacing, and muddled thematic elements, but Zegler's fire (combined with some memorable costuming and action set pieces) lends this film some spark. Absolutely zero chemistry between the two leads. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is enjoyable and recaptures the essence of the series. Can be bloated at times but the performances and script carry the film home.

Themes of oppression, dystopia, and societal inequity are relevant to today‚Äôs injustices. The film is compelling and dark, and benefits from an impressive cast including Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage, plus evocative production design and some gut-wrenching twists.","So glad HG is back.  Really enjoyed this, some imparts moved too quickly but overall really enjoyed the tie in. As a fan of the first 4 movies and the 3 books I was pretty excited going in to this one. I am sure I have some bias in that I did enjoy the setting and kind of lore of the Hunger Games series so much, and was dieing to know more. 

This movie really clicked all the boxes for me. I enjoyed the characters, enjoyed the setting the most (just love seeing a glimpse into the past like this) and thought that it was and is a must see this year! This was a very good movie. The characters development was excellent. Really enjoyed it. Hooked from start to finish. this movie could have been way better, too much singing the actress who played Grey good singer but didn't care for the performance Snow was good but the whole guys in skirts stupid overall left feeling disappointed Great movie. Left a lot of unanswered questions, but provided a good back story for some of the characters in the Hunger Games series.  Can't wait to see if another movie is released. GOD IT WAS SO GOOD the character development the pacing the thrill the songs just everything blew me away. I've never left a theater feeling so blown away and just ""wow"". Snow is such a complex character and this movie showed us so much insight into the world of Panem and the motivations behind such a twisted villian. This was a great addition to the franchise and I'm so glad I saw it Very very good. You must see it If you liked the first movies and actually read all 4 books then you will think this is a great prequel. If you are in it for returning characters, you may not like it. It was different than the other movies, in a good way. People giving this movie 1 star are silly. This movie was good at first but then it gets to a point. Where it doesn‚Äôt know what kind of plot to follow. Many awkward face shot scenes, tooooo much singing (I‚Äôm down for some songs but dude come on) the ended is long and drawn out to the point where I lost interest in it. 0/10 don‚Äôt watch. gran historia no s√© pq apenas ni soport√© el libro, ayuda me enamor√© del villano the main character is hot The hunger games take another twist because the people have grown tired of the predictably of the games.Each contestant is assigned a mentor from capital city to assist them. It was dull, and it glorified and humanised a genocidal maniac, which pissed me off so much. The movie was solely a money grab and not an addition to an established story. It was dryly written and had no soul.
Don't waste a single dollar on this trash-can-fire of a film. I don't walk out of cinemas mid film but I'm glad I did with this one! I walked into this movie my expectations through the roof only to be met by the disappointing reality when I did not in fact see the return of the main character district 8 hospital helper. All I can say is that I am utterly disappointed by this and it will take me a while to recuperate. You know a movie is bad when you can see what they are aiming for and it cant hit each mark, im not sure if its the writing or the acting. I just feel like they could have made it the actual war and subsequent shock horror of the start of the Games. This movie really let down the whole franchise. Great if youre a fan of the series!  Loved learning how Snow became Snow.  Wish wed learned what really happened to Lacey, however the door is still open! I really enjoyed the first parts. The ending seemed convoluted and a bit quick, considering all the ground work laid up to this point. Overall was a good watch though. I don't know enough about the source material to comment on that piece. boring, confusing, too many characters. overall just bad Too long. Confusing. Terrible character development. Ugh, pure garbage. Rachel Zegler is great, it's too bad she's in the wrong Hunger Games movie. Lucy Gray is also no Katniss Everdeen and never will be - this prequel should never have been made as it lacks everything that made the first 4 movies entertaining to watch. This movie is ""yellow Snow"" - don't taste it!"
Action,animal_2023_2,"Trashy, idiotic, and filled with disgusting bloody violence that's overly repetitive, Animal is excruciatingly too long at 201 minutes. This garbage movie has no redeeming qualities. It's yet another stupid story about feuding and vengeful families. Beyond the never ending reign of bullets and butcherings, both Animal and Kapoor's vicious Ranvijay remain hollow. Animal is a complicated film with a top-tier Ranbir Kapoor, who delivers a powerhouse performance that is worth the price of admission alone. What the film lacks in substance, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes up for with sheer audacity and bloodshed. Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly protagonist, but in spite of the movie‚Äôs explosive action, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking outrage than with telling a coherent story. Boring, blood-spattered film... Animal‚Äôs terrible attitude to women runs alongside a cunning use of India‚Äôs religious minorities.  Bigger, longer, bloodier: Animal is all that and more. A story which is cheerfully misogynistic, morally bankrupt and stomach-churningly violent.  All of which I could have endured if the drama and emotions had held.  It is easy to dismiss Animal as an indulgent film, one that achieves none of what it sets out to. It is. It is repulsive, revolting, and one-and-a-half- hours too long. But it is also a film that unravels as retaliation. The film washes past you, like sandpaper being rubbed against your aesthetic and moral convictions.  Watch Animal to see Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor rising above the ridiculous to give a sublime performance. Ranbir Kapoor stars in a blood-soaked drama about daddy issues that is screaming at the top of its lungs with nothing to say. Ranbir Kapoor plays one of the vilest protagonists in cinema history. ANIMAL is a pretty crazy, but somehow totally original and fresh THE GODFATHER remix, with an insane Ranbir Kapoor, a super strong Rashmika Mandanna, great music and, above all, the right amount of humor and irony. The main objective is to serve up everything and the kitchen sink. It can‚Äôt be called a cinematic feast, as it is a chore for moviegoers forced to digest heaps of plot points and tangents.  At three hours 21 minutes, Animal is relentless as a euphoric medley of feral rage and dance of the dysfunctional. The twists go on well until end credits as more blood is splattered our way. Welcome to the jungle. Like nearly every factor here, the songs and blood-soaked interludes alike are not without skill, but get kick-dropped into an inorganic whole uninterested in integrating them to sustained, logical or emotionally credible effect. During the interval, I was at a loss of theories. I didn‚Äôt know what to make of him or the film. All I could ask was: What‚Äôs the point? Why is Animal? Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling. Reptile-eyed even at his smouldering best, Kapoor‚Äôs career-best performance makes Animal tough to stomach, but equally difficult to ignore. Ranbir Kapoor's action tale is flawed, overtly violent and misogynistic...","Suberb movie ranbir's acting is spontaneous üî• The movie dragged a lot...Overkill.
Starts off interesting but ends up with a bitter taste..

Narcissism, gaslighting, adultery, short tempered, anger issues, daddy issues, detachment issues ..and the list goes on..

Had to detox my brain just for watching this movieüß† Sat down for the entire 3hr 20min and didnt get bored. Animal movie is the collage of the insta reels put together unimaginably, to ignite the spark within the youth with low IQ and even lower span of attention. But that is what an Indian audience will get, who grew up on Salmanolothic and Govindaesque mindless flicks of 3 hours. What a waste of so much talent, but a much appreciated effort by the post production and marketing team to make this project a monetary success. Amazing movie, 10 out of 10 ‚ÄúThe Arab middle easterners are here; the Arabs are here! Can I rate this 0/5?
Mysogynist director and his pathetic script. This movie disgusts me.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga definitely is disturbed in the head to make movies like this one and Kabir Singh LOL. Top notch acting, music, action. Excellent performance by Ranbir and all other co-stars. It has some short comings, but is perfect combination of top class acting, music, action, emotions, family and relationships. Waste of money and time Bollywood has once again proved that it can't parallel Hollywood.

Animal is among the longest movies of the Bollywood, spanning over 3 hours 20 minutes. Yet it's a total waste of time. Even the title has no direct connection with the plot. 

The attempt is to present a deep psychodrama of father son relationship. But the plot is a thorough failure. But no doubt, the performance of Ranbir Kapoor is good and spreads colors on the canvas.

Yet the youth will love this movie as it shows brotherhood and stubborn attitude.

Overall, the film is a tasteless amalgam of action and emotions. It's better to watch some stock drama than to waste time on this fazool film. It makes sex unsexy and for a movie with this budget very shitty editing Absolutely endearing story of a sons love to his father and his family. Must watch for any Bharatiya. I think this movie has a negative impact on society. A little over the top but definitely worth a watch for mature audience. Worst movie ever. That much violence is insane and would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of time. What the f*ck did I watch! First 40 minutes were too abrupt and quickly stitched to try to make a point which wasnt landing. Action sequences were the savior amidst weak acting and characters played by Anil Kapoor. Outstanding Performance by Ranbeer Kapoor !! Unbelievable movie! Too much violence and not family oriented Excellent movie. Love to see the father and son bonding."
Action,silent_night_2023,"...all-too-quickly collapses under the weight of its intriguing yet progressively untenable gimmick... This comeback movie has a lot of what Woo is famous for, such as operatic gunfights, but it also has something new: there is almost no dialogue over the 104-minute run-time. Those wanting a John Woo return will have to wait. Unfortunately, Silent Night is too bland, boring, and poorly made to bring him back to the mainstream. Strikes the perfect balance between intense action sequences and equally commanding emotional moments to create a stunning film that fires on all cylinders. This film reunites us with an old teacher who has become a competent imitator of his students. [Full review in Spanish] It is worth noting the poor aim that gang members have in general, and against Brian in particular. [Full review in Spanish] Narratively, there's something missing here but once it gets going, the action is there; it holds your attention.  The new movie feels too simple for him [Woo], a thriller with only vengeance on its brain. Great for those who just want action, action, action and don't care about character development. While the Chinese-Hong Kong filmmaker returns with a fairly minor film... there are a few self-tributes and a handful of pure tense-filled scenes that allow us to remember the good (best) times in Woo's cinema with a smile. [Full review in Spanish] Silent Night is a collection of parts that never become the film the trailer promises, or the film I think Woo intended. And yet, for the occasional flourish of the old mad genius that survives here, I'm still glad I saw it on a big screen. A curious experience: an action thriller with sequences of brutal violence, which tries to justify the actions of its protagonist in the most sentimental way possible. Full review in Spanish. Silent Night will not teach anyone anything, but I found it a highly watchable, if subpar work from a master filmmaker. That‚Äôs not a recommendation, but for some of you, the message should be clear. If you can stomach the first act as an interesting and flawed creative experiment and enjoy revenge stories with bloody denouements, though, there‚Äôs still something to enjoy here by the time the credits roll. Just don‚Äôt expect much from it. Blood spurts forth in great volume as the bullets criss-cross the frame, yet Woo manages to keep focus on his anti-hero‚Äôs humanity and motive...a ripping action drama.  It's bad, but at least it's also super depressing. If you think I care that you might see spoilers in this review, then you completely underestimate my utter contempt for this movie. The director‚Äôs first Hollywood film in twenty years makes it clear that he hasn‚Äôt lost his touch, but a stronger (or at least more interesting) foundation to launch his signature style on might have made for a more satisfying comeback. Joel Kinnaman descends into full bore badassery in the feral heat of director John Woo‚Äôs wordless venge-fest. Though the veteran director has mellowed, the pure energy pulsing through Silent Night proves Woo is still a grandmaster of kinetic cinema.","Horrible. Absolutely horrible. I am a John Woo fan, but this movie was not enjoyable in any way. The story is tired. We have seen this tale of revenge too many times, and the only way to make it worth seeing again, is to get us invested in the characters and reward us with highly-stylized John Woo action. Unfortunately that doesn't happen in this movie. So boring. (I was with a fried who did not want to leave, otherwise I would have left the theater about 20 minutes into it.) The whole car-play violence is uninteresting, and the gun-play lacks all coolness that one would usually associate with John Woo. 

So how bad was it? Bad enough I would say not to bother watching it at the theater, at home, or anywhere ... even if it is free. Complete waste of time. While the premise of a movie with no dialogue due to the main characters initial trauma is unique, and it did create for some truly great moments for Joel Kinnaman to shine through with his ability to convey raw emotion. It made for a long movie with a tenuous grip on a plot. Well, we all know that John Woo makes very violent over the top exaggerated movies, but some are just lame. This one, in fact, starts out really well, with a cool chasing scene, but then comes an endless boring part of Joel's (and his wife's) suffering which we would all skip if we were at home on cable, and thus avoid 75% of the movie. When it finally, and I mean finally, comes to the showdown (one really can't call it a climax as nothing is slowly rising before),  the typical Woo ""Shoot-out"" is so ridiculous and idiotic that one wants to leave before it is even over. Actually half of the spectators walked out during the movie (and I have never seen so many leave early in any movie during my whole cinephile life). I'd say it is the worst flick Woo ever made. 2/10 points (and without the opening scene it should be 1 point). If I could give 0 stars I would. Half the movie is just dead kid exposition and the other half is mostly a boring training montage with a tiny sprinkle of action. Every event in the movie lasts way longer than it should and the whole thing feels like they're desperately trying to hit the two hour mark. Good premise, but not having any dialogue really threw me off. And the constant flashbacks were overkill. The last 15 minutes became an extremely unrealistic and didnt pair well with the rest of the movie. Good action scenes with great acting Qu√© manera de perder mi tiempo en el cine con esta pel√≠cula. Me qued√© dormido la mayor parte del tiempo, nunca pens√© que en una ya que soy un ignorante en el cine; pero que parte tan importante son los di√°logos y la m√∫sica.
Yo s√© que se llama venganza silenciosa en M√©xico pero era demasiado el silencio que me daba amnsiedad y sin una buena m√∫sica que acompa√±ara al pobre actor decadente se sent√≠a un gran vac√≠o. 
Rescatable unas pocas escenas de acci√≥n. Se sent√≠an m√°s en los sentimientos del mudito, cuando uno va por la venganza y la sed de sangre que habr√≠a de tener el anglosaj√≥n pero qued√≥ a deberme mucho. Poorly written mediocre acting -- not at all what we expected from John Woo.  Took WAY too long to set the characters and story up,  The action scenes in the trailer are pretty much it.   By about the tenth time he plays the music box people in the theatre were openly groaning.  One of the people in the couple next to us was sound asleep at the end. The movie had good and bad parts. what we did not like about the movie's ending was how he died and the cop died. it should have ended where someone found them they both ended up in the hospital and that's how the movie should have ended where they were okay. I HAVE NEVER WALKED OUT OF A MOVIE UNTIL TODAY.  Dude I know the movie is called silent night BUT DAMN, most movies are called certain things‚Ä¶ and not ACTUALLY relate to the title. I mean nooOooo one SPOKE the entire movie. All I heard was the guy next to me eat his candy. Total SILENCE. JEEZ MAN, but you BET I walked out of that theater and watched another. Excellent movie with a spot on effect to fit the title. Wow. That was an hour and half of my life I will not get back. I get it he can no longer speak but his wife won't ether? Zero dialog. My mail man could be the star in this movie. No talent needed, Unrealistic and poor directing. Waste of my time and money. An excellent John Woo action film. Full of explosions and shooting. Don‚Äôt expect any talking. This is John Woo doing what he does with his craft!!! It‚Äôs ok but Wait til this comes out on free tv. This movie had a great script and the acting as great. This is must see movie done by John Woo Ignore the negative reviews. Yes, it‚Äôs true there was no dialogue in this flick but that doesn‚Äôt mean it was a ‚Äòsilent movie.‚Äô There was background music and some police radio chatter. Had I not read the reviews, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd have realized there was no person to person dialogue. The movie still ‚Äòcommunicated.‚Äô It‚Äôs a vengeance action flick and that‚Äôs just what you get. Wow this movie is amazing! Had us so into it! Very suspenseful and full of action! We enjoyed it very much ! (: What a total waste of time! Save your money and don‚Äôt go see this one! If I could give it negative stars, I would! it was your typical Revenge movie nothing special about it his kid is killed so he kills a bunch of people has almost nothing to do with Christmas"
Action,the_marvels,"""The Marvels"" is as uninteresting as it is irrelevant, as its opening scenes make clear. [Full Review in Spanish] It's not Marvelous.  The Marvels neglects to fulfill the most basic tenets of being its own movie.  The Marvels is a perfectly fine superhero flick - sitting amongst a rocky at best Phase Four and a one for two score so far in the latest Phase. A pedal-to-the-medal and often humorous adventure that serves as a sequel to both the 2019 movie Captain Marvel and the 2020 MCU Disney+ series Ms. Marvel. I feel like they played it ""safe"", which significantly lowered the stakes for me. I loved the short running time but this movie struggled to find its footing.  This is far from the worst MCU film. It's actually quite charming and had some fun fight scenes. But tonally it was all over the place. Shout out to Iman Vellani who is incredible.  Inconsistent, interminable - and silly! It could have been a lot worse.  The primary plot lines are fun, yet they can also be confusing, and at times it becomes a little too much--although totally enjoyed the three lead girls working together. It's not going to win over people that are on the fence... but it's not bad. The Marvels is a diverting, easy to digest cosmic adventure that zips by at a breakneck pace and reminds us of the importance of family and friendship. Brie Larson leads a super-trio that works hard to blast some fun into this confusing adventure.

 ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù delivers a fun, well-paced superhero movie anchored by three solid, charismatic performances.   Oh boy, I am so tired of the MCU... Now it's the same film over and over and over again.  This is false sophistication, especially in this case, when it covers up the visual ineptitude and chaos of The Marvels.  The whole ""Captain Marvel"" franchise is diluted and shredded in this average action thriller. [The Marvels] feels like the finale to a season of television we never got, and perhaps a series would have given each of these characters the time they needed to fully explore each of their individual issues. It‚Äôs all rather standard superhero sci-fi ... with the welcome variation that almost all of the key characters are women. Vellani is funny and sweet as Kamala, an unabashed Captain Marvel fangirl who doesn‚Äôt hide her excitement at joining the fray.  If Marvel is trying to win back audience enthusiasm, centering its characters and a sense of fun is the right approach. And teaming up with talented directors like Nia DaCosta goes a long way on executing that approach","Another messy poorly written marvel movie. But the audio... Worst audio editing I've ever heard. Just noise pollution really. The movie is good but the characters are making me upset. 

SPOILERS!! ‚ö†Ô∏è
Why close to the end Monica suggested to save Dar-Benn when she got stabbed by the shard of glass? Then she picked up her hammer and tried to kill them again like girl why did u even suggest that ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è 
Second, The little girl Kamala is annoying me too.
Like girl be quiet sometimes üò≠ then how does she not get in trouble for leaving her home and destroying the house in the beginning‚Ä¶ my mom would've slapped tf out of me üíÄ

The movie is good but I like to just say stuff for saying sake. Don't take none of this serious it's a good movie in general should watch it if you like marvel. Personajes divertidos y una historia entretenida y trepidante hacen de The Marvels una adici√≥n agradable al Universo Cinematogr√°fico de Marvel la recomiendo Short for a MCU flick, but it has everything the die hards will want, good action and typical Marvel humor, though that does not make up for its lackluster characters (Ms Marvel aside) and it‚Äôs bland bottom tier villain. I don't like the constant switching but it was better than expected It's the worth movie in all Marvel Universe.  Just a collection of scenes without a specific plot. Only the cat and Kamala play their roles. I highly not recommend 
spending 1:30 hours of your time watching this movie! I will never have this part of my life i wasted watching this huge pile of garbage. Geez. How did they mess this up so badly. Just how. TW;SPOILERS
The Marvels (2023) is another bad Marvel movie. Bri Larson, Iman Valenti and Toyanah Parris all play good character,it's funny. But there's like 30% of the movie that just feels dumb like when Monica gets trapped on the alternate universe or when she ends up being on that universe, as the dead one and not her mother so it just confuses me and I think that's a main part of why I hate it so much, there's too much of everything, and people saying their lines to fast. Like Iman Valenti's character always fan-girling over Ms Marvel even deciding to name her character that in a goddamn stupid montage. I can't stress enough that if ur reading this, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THE MARVELS (2023) Fast paced action movie of how an ordinary girl joins up with Captain Marvel & discovers her fate of defending the Universe. Sigo sin creerme que antes de su estreno en cines, The Marvels se haya convertido en lo que es para muchos, ""la peor pel√≠cula del UCM"" (incluso dicen que es ""incluso m√°s decepcionante"" que la pel√≠cula de la Capitana Marvel). Fue que, por toda esta pol√©mica, decid√≠ ya verlo. ¬øY qu√© opino yo? No es una mala pel√≠cula. Incluso, hasta me parece mejor que su precuela. ¬øPor qu√©? Miren, quiero aclarar que voy a ser sincero y solo es mi opini√≥n personal. Nadie me pago para decir est√° cr√≠tica (ni Disney, porque ni me conocen). Tampoco soy fanboy. it wasn't as bad as the Youtubers were saying. I had to see if it would be that bad & it is not. Mediocre is what it is. I do not understand who they made this movie for. How can you make a profit pandering to such a small portion of your audience. Making a movie most people do not want to watch. Capt. Marvel was OK , this was . . . Divertida no muy larga especial para la familia Lots of comedy. I knew what was going to be the next movie. a  catastrophic disaster Had heard mixed reviews so decided to give this a go. Rather disappointed as it's not like the other movies at all, there's an expectation people will have watched some of the TV series (I'm assuming)?.. no idea which ones.

Anyway, it flies into it at the start with no introduction to any characters and the rest of it is a hot mess of things that again seem to require previous knowledge one or more TV series to understand what the hell is going on or who the characters are.

Should be a 0.5 star review, but I've upgraded to 1.5 as Brie Larson (seemingly) hasn't got the stick up her arse anymore. I found this movie to be an exciting, evenly paced super hero movie. There was nothing exceptional about it, but also nothing at all bad. If you want a fun evening of stepping into the world of Marvel with some beloved characters and some new ones introduced then I think it fits the bill. The Marvels had its ups and downs, but overall, it's a good movie. I honestly believe it was better than the first one. The Brie larson, Teyonah , and Iman were great üî•üî•üî• The villains master plan is plot ripped of from Spaceballs. Might as well be watching spaceballs instead of this. Although at times there were a couple of pacing issues, but the film does have some great moments especially from Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan who stood out. Snoozefest of marvellous proportions."
Action,die_hard,"To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It‚Äôs no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to ‚Äúdo a Die Hard‚Äù, it‚Äôs still hard to top. Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan‚Äôs 1988 action classic isn‚Äôt just set at Christmastime‚Äîit embodies the very spirit of the holiday. The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered. Give Die Hard a fresh spin this year; it's the most joyous Christmas film of all!  I really appreciated the interpersonal relationship between him and his wife. It wasn't slow but it was taking its time. [It] may be the best action movie EVER. It's another anti-cheer holiday selection, but one that keeps on giving - rewatchable sans saturation... Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels. Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as ""Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you."" Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable. A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn. The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming. The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish] It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen. Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together. Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened. From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film. It's as though the filmmakers approached each scene by asking themselves how entertaining they could make it. One of the very best action pictures of all time... Yippe-ki-yay indeed.","Best Christmas movie ever! I said it! Fantastic Christmas movie Bruce Willis himself said Die Hard is not a Christmas movie. it's a great, classic, action movie by all means. Is Batman Returns a Christmas movie? That movie is set during Christmas. Think about that ü§î.  üòÄ Classic 80s adventure‚Ä¶ and yea it is a Christmas movie! Great to see a classic on the big screen the way it was intended. I hadn't seen this movie until it was offered in the Dolby theater at my local AMC. It was awesome! Such a fun story with crazy fun dialogue and action. Loved it. all time action great Where does the ambulance come from? Why does the elevator explode? I just had the good fortune to see an original print on the big screen, and this movie is still as fun the 20th time as it is the first. Sure it plays heavy on 80s heavy action, comeback lines and buddy chemistry, but nothing beats seeing a vulnerable, grade A Bruce taking out Rickman and his henchman one by one while having a few fun twists along the way. I have seen this movie so many times and it never gets old! I love Die Hard! It is a timeless classic! Loved seeing this classic on the big screen! one of the best Xmas Movies there is! Merry Christmas everyone!!!! This is the way to enjoy a movie. What movies used to be like. Fun. Third Best Christmas Movie ever made, right behind A Christmas Carol (Alastair Sim) and A Christmas Story but just ahead of Scrooged and Christmas Vacation! First time watching and wow, they just don‚Äôt make movies like this anymore. Was a cool watch in theaters, and I will always consider this a Christmas movie no matter what A towering achievement! One of my all time favorite action films Great action movie from start to finish. Funny one liners. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are perfect playing good and bad guys. It's just my opinion but this is not a Christmas movie. It takes place during Christmas but it's not about Christmas. Last thing, yippee-ki-yay mutha f@cker!"
Action,the_oath_2023,"The Oath is a faith-based movie about Judeo-Christian historical people, but this tedious drama is actually very soulless. The characters, story, and filmmaking are woefully generic, while the acting performances are dismally substandard. There are some well done elements throughout the film, but there are also moments where things collapse from the pressure. At various points resembling ‚ÄúGladiator,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Passion of the Christ,‚Äù ‚ÄúDances with Wolves,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Last of the Mohicans,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBraveheart,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Oath‚Äù mixes elements of drama, action, romance, and fantasy to stirring effect. I appreciate the filmmakers' intentions, but pledging to watch 'The Oath' may cause severe regrets. It's certainly no sillier in any way that I could see than, say, Conan the Barbarian or the Lord of the Rings flicks. And it's at least as heartfelt. The fact that in terms of subject matter this is an unusual film doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good one... it‚Äôs solemn, repetitive and unexciting.  Clunky, dull and undercooked while very low on thrills, suspense and emotional depth.  A limp, underfinanced Pre-Columbian ‚ÄúLast of the Mohicans‚Äù action adventure...and a dull MesoAmerican thriller built on Mormonism‚Äôs foundation myth, with just enough magical thinking thrown in to make everything presented here play as eye-rolling hokum.","The Oath had great cinematography, beautiful music, and a compelling story. I want to see it again! This film is not perfect and not for everyone but I appreciated the way it explores the sometimes painful experience of being alone, with Moroni being the last of his people after the heartbreaking loss of his family, and imagines what it might have meant to him to find companionship. It is a plausible depiction of the Book of Mormon taking artistic license to imagine and tell details of the story that are unavailable to us while staying true to the book. Leaps and bounds ahead of any previous attempt at bringing the Book of Mormon to film, I hope this opens the door for more to come! So proud of Darin Scott for finally Making this happen!

This is a film I've been looking forward to for years, as I've been following Darin all along.

This is my honest opinion of what I observed and felt during the film!

The overall cinematography was superb, with breathtaking shots of a beautiful backdrop!

The costumes, language, and set was phenomenal!

Some of the acting was on point and other scenes left a feeling that there was something lacking‚Ä¶ room for improvement for sure. I feel like some of the lines were canned, where others could have been developed further.

I love the vision that Darin has, and the idea of bringing the Book of Mormon to life is fantastic‚Ä¶and I think the lead character could be someone more polished and believable in their portrayal of Moroni‚Ä¶there were so many scenes that were a bit too much‚Ä¶sort of cheesy‚Ä¶

There were also parts that left me wanting to see more‚Ä¶such as when Moroni tells of his fathers of the past‚Ä¶it would be so incredible to have flashbacks to the times and people he is referring to, with vivid real life portrayals‚Ä¶

Overall, I felt that parts of the movie landed, and others lacked impact‚Ä¶therefore leaving me feeling like it could have been better at the end.

I hope that filmmakers will continue to utilize the beautiful stories of the Book of Mormon and courageously follow the lead of Darin Scott to venture into a world where these beautiful and often tragic stories are brought to the big screen!

If I were to score the heart of the movie, I'd give it a 10‚Ä¶over all for me, it's a solid 6.5, maybe 7!

With love and a desire to offer honest feedback,

- Paul Absolutely loved it!! Great watch, motivating and inspirational, hard to find on the big screen now days! It was a bit slow for me but I enjoyed the story and its connection to the Book of Morman. For a nonmain stream big-budget movie, this was amazing. well written and the acting was outstanding. If you have ever wondered what the Book of Mormon is about, or who wrote it, here is your chance to discover some insight and be entertained at the same time.
As our nation is crumbling under disbelief, hear a message from our forefathers who lived on this land and speak to us from the dust, a warning, turn back to God and live. Finally this hero of ancient times comes to life in a quality production. I would like to see more films on this subject in the future. Some scenes of violence not always necessary, but one of the best inspiring movie to see this end of the year. Loved the movie, can't wait until it's out on blue ray. I really liked this movie. Ive been backing it for 13 years. It wasnt what I expected but I really enjoyed this. If this movie does well it means we get Reign of Judges. If this is an indicator i will be. Also the fight scenes were very realistic but  still exciting! Go Watch it! This is the first Latter-day Saint film with an epic feel--think Gladiator or Braveheart. But rather than a classic warrior-protagonist as in those movies, Darin Scott's Moroni is true to the character in the Book of Mormon - Moroni is masculine but he is a devout Christian, who spends his free time studying Scripture and in prayer. When I got home from watching the movie, I felt motivated to be better and to do better, because I had just watched a convincing, three-dimensional portrayal of what it means to be a godly man. You owe it to yourself to watch this film in the theater. Amazing production. The music and scenic shots were great. The acting was solid. Costumes and makeup looked incredibly legit. There were touching spots in the story despite sometimes moving a little slow. I hope to see more films like this made. I felt the creators tried very hard to give the film an epic feel this history deserves. That's hard to get across without explaining a little more of the history. I started to feel that more at the end of the movie but might have helped people understand if more history/substance was given in the beginning. Please keep making these! The Oath tells a compelling story with ambitious cinematography, minimal dialogue, and a simple plot. Job well done capturing the solitude of a man without community and his reintroduction to human interaction. The acting is subtle, with good character development throughout. What I appreciate most about Mr. Scott's writing, directing, and acting is the deep reverence for life shown. Where many films today explore the relativity of good and evil, Scott draws a useful line in The Oath: evil is to treat life cheaply and good is to hold life sacred. What's more, this demarcation rings true. Scott's invitation to viewers to hold human life and relationships sacred is a vitally important one. Peace can fill our lives and the world when individuals, families, communities respect life, extend forgiveness, seek reconciliation, and promote the good of the whole human family. I wish more mainstream media exhibited such vision and used its power for good. Bravo Scott and team for your bold commitment to sharing good and promoting peace. Wife and I thought it was amazing. The story was moving and portrayed the struggle of choice and consequences and the meaning of keeping true to your word.  The music was moving as was the breathtaking cinematography.  Highly recommend seeing this movie. I am so glad I decided to watch this movie.  The visuals throughout the movie were a feast for the eyes. The music score was amazing. The story was awe inspiring. I highly recommend watching this movie. You will leave the theater feeling better than when you arrived. -FREEDOM!- So cool to see Moroni come to life. It makes me put myself in his shoes and wonder if I could be like him. It is filmed in such a beautiful place.
Loved it This movie was incredibly well cast.  The cinematography was superb, and storyline was simply inspiring.  Darin Scott is a genius storyteller and even better actor. It was good. I did enjoy it. Not what I expected. Understanding the intention behind it, not sure if it got there. For a low budget film, it was done well with the music and cinematography. A little more help with the story and character depth and it would have been a phenomenal movie. Great music, acting and cinematography. But why does Aaron seem to have a pirate accent? Interesting spin on the untold life of Moroni after the plates were finished. I‚Äôm not Native, but I imagine some portrayals may be offensive to them. The story line was a bit slow and didn‚Äôt seem to pick up until King Aaron meets Moroni towards the end. Also, some of the writing didn‚Äôt make sense to me. I am an inactive member of the church, honestly I wasn't to sure about seeing this movie.
I went anyways to show some support. 

In the beginning I wasn't sure about the acting part of the lady that played the husband of   Moroni. However the acting picked up from there and was progressively way better as the movie went on. I liked having a storyline, I feel if there was no storyline in the movie, it would be like watching one of those boring movies they have you watch in church. 

My son brought his girlfriend who has never been exposed to the teachings of the Book of mormon and  she loved it, especially the relationship between the sisters. 

I really enjoyed watching the movie, if I hadn't I would have walked out and I didn't. I didn't even want to get up and go to the bathroom bc I was going to miss part of the show.

I have read reviews pertaining to Moroni showing and flexing muscles ect. Let me ask you, if you ran around in the forest for 20 years in survival mode and carried a set of encrypted gold plates around that weigh between approx 40 lbs consistently you to would have would be ripped too! 

Great job Darin and Michelle and cast. A love story showing that even the most evil people can change. Knowing and living the truth makes them free on earth and beyond earthly existence."
Action,fast_charlie,"Pierce Brosnan has a wry sense of humor in this slick and violent piece of pulp entertainment. Phillip Noyce‚Äôs well-seasoned, blood-splattered throwback, a smooth ride that doesn‚Äôt wear out its welcome at a brisk 90 minutes. In addition to setting the scene gorgeously on the Gulf Coast, director Phillip Noyce knows how to keep things moving slickly. And he also finds ways to reveal internal motivations in characters even when things get silly. A weird noir that has so many permutations that even when you see them coming, they're italicized so you feel fondly towards all the tropes.  Pierce Brosnan drops his Irish elocution for a Southern twang in a breezy crime thriller with unexpected dark humor. Fast Charlie isn't extraordinary but has solid action, good cast chemistry, and enough macabre chuckles to warrant a recommendation. ‚ÄúFast Charlie‚Äù doesn‚Äôt break any new ground in the genre, but it‚Äôs the sort of engaging escapade that Hollywood used to turn out with ease.  The movie adds little that's new to the tough-guy redemption genre ‚Äî apart from a dead raccoon and some tasty tomato sauce ‚Äî but it does revolve around the always likable Pierce Brosnan, who plays the courtly but dangerous Charlie Swift. Brosnan brings his brand of sly, flirtatious, reluctant heroism to the role. He and Baccarin make a good May/December pairing. Caan's last film. Talented collaborators on both sides of the camera have done better than this far-fetched Deep South crime thriller, although it intermittently rises above the formulaic fray. This is the farthest thing in the cinematic firmament from a world-changer you can imagine, but as an evening‚Äôs entertainment, it‚Äôll more than do. The fact that Brosnan and Baccarin make us believe ... their ... strange relationship ... makes the material feel less routine than it could have been. The real motor that sustains Fast Charlie for the duration of its breezy 90-minute running time is the will-they won‚Äôt-they romance between Brosnan and Baccarin, both actors cultivating a palpable sense of intimacy. Feels like reheated Elmore Leonard leftovers. ‚ÄúFast Charlie‚Äù doesn‚Äôt jump off the screen, but it‚Äôs an engaging ride with morally dubious people trying to figure out a future that isn‚Äôt guaranteed. An exhilarating, suspenseful and wickedly funny action thriller. Pierce Brosnan is at his best.  We‚Äôve seen plenty of cinematic aging hitmen looking to retire to a more peaceful life before, but thanks to Brosnan‚Äôs ageless charm and a subtly rendered love story underpinning the proceedings, we‚Äôve never rooted for one quite as much. Phillip Noyce‚Äôs charming if melancholic Southern gangland caper grants an old mob fixer a new lease of love and life Master-craftsman Phillip Noyce has built a well-constructed revenge thriller around star Pierce Brosnan. Anyone looking for a good old-fashioned thriller will have to search far and wide for one that works better than Fast Charlie.  I was taken with this minor gangster film because it does much without doing much. ‚ÄúFast Charlie‚Äù is a modest genre movie, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs good about it.","A decent little crime thriller, although the age gap between the main characters is a little too much to quite pull the story off convincingly. Fast Charlie fits perfectly into the constraints of its genre but with enough charm to make for a decent weekend movie night watch. Acting - 10/10
Photography - 15/10
Direction 16/10
Script - 10/10
Overall score - Effing fantastic. Get yourself the biggest possible box of popcorn as you watch this, and make sure you see it while its in cinemas. Pure entertainment. Yep, this was excellent. Boomshakala! Funny, tense surprisingly moving and a brilliant cast. Big fan. Movies like this aren't made any more. Really disappointing to see such a lack of promotion and only a handful of cinemas. There are certain kinds of movies that need to be seen in the cinema, this is one of them. Sucks that everyone is going to see it on their shitty TV's as opposed to how it was meant to be seen. Regardless it's an awesome ride, so check it out. Man seeing James Caan in this is so bittersweet and the fact he plays someone who's dealing with a bit of dementia makes it really sad as you wonder what his last days were actually like. Brosnan was charming as ever. He carries so much weight every time he is in the frame. Didn't see the twist at the end coming (no spoilers) and overall, I didn't expect to learn a whole bunch of new ways to kill a man whilst also feeling so much emotion. Never knew Brosnan was such a talented actor! Completely different from anything I've seen him in! Loved the love story. Big fan of Baccarin after watching her in Gotham. I've read people complaining about Brosnan's accent in this, I think he absolutely nailed it. Those complaining just can't get ‚ÄòBond Brosnan' out of your mind. I'm from where it's set and I can vouch for the accent. Loved this. Had no idea what to expect and got a gangsta film and a beautiful drama all in one! Check it out. Absolutely loved watching this. Despite being a gangster film, it felt different. Action was great and entertaining but so was the drama. Didn't expect that. Highly recommend. ""Fast Charlie"" is a gangster film like no other, breaking the mold with its tenderness and depth. The film's emotional core lies in the unexpected gentleness of its narrative, particularly in the bond between Charlie (Pierce Brosnan) and his boss Stan (James Caan). Their loyalty and affection showcase a softer side of the genre, rarely seen in mob dramas. Similarly, the burgeoning love story, blossoming without even a single kiss, adds a poignant layer to the narrative.

Warwick Thornton's cinematography elevates this sentiment, capturing the essence of the story through beautiful, non-traditional shots that stand apart from typical gangster films. The visual storytelling is both elegant and evocative, bringing a new aesthetic to a familiar genre.

Complementing this is the film's score, which masterfully underscores the narrative's progression. The opening upbeat tracks draw you in, setting the stage for the story, while the emotional beats towards the end mirror the depth and complexity of the characters' journeys. The music enhances the film's tender moments, adding a layer of richness to the storytelling.

""Fast Charlie"" is a refreshing take on the gangster genre, blending action with unexpected warmth and beauty. It's a testament to the versatility of the genre and the power of storytelling that can evoke a wide range of emotions. it was great. I like the plot twist Wow did that suck. Boring and predictable. Terrible fake accents. good film about a man and his choices. his loyalty to his friends and methods never changes and those who he befriends learn that they can rely and trust him. this story has been told billions of times but still holds you till the end. a good moving story, don't be afraid, watch it. Great cast, very entertaining movie. Just barely not a waste of time. Very enjoyable and fun to watch."
Action,concrete_utopia,"Um turns what could have been one more post-apocalyptic thriller into an intriguing challenge of a movie. Concrete Utopia holds us in its grip. Concrete Utopia remains emotionally convincing despite being ideologically hollow. Director Um is nothing if not fiercely committed to his dystopian gimmick, for better or worse, and his actors follow suit.  A natural disaster of such magnitude might never happen, but a societal one as depicted here increasingly seems too close for any comfort. Concrete Utopia is hardly the first disaster movie in which panic trumps morality. But this vision of a ‚Äúutopia‚Äù smashed to pieces is more disturbing and believable than most. Combines the actual disaster, in frightening & realistic effects, with the disaster of losing humanity in the face of the extreme circumstance. It‚Äôs beyond whether the strong will survive, it wonders if decency will also prevail. With director interview. Reels us in, jolts and even shocks us and gets the viewer thinking, at least a little.  Concrete Utopia mostly hits on familiar themes, but it executes them so well‚Äîand with a healthy dash of the dark, satirical flavor that made Parasite and Squid Game so deliciously enjoyable‚Äîthat you‚Äôll easily find yourself not minding too much. It's a powerful movie, very well-made and well-directed with a contemporary resonance. Though the humor and acting in ‚ÄúConcrete Utopia‚Äù can occasionally feel broad, Lee‚Äôs viscerally monstrous performance grounds a high-stakes drama.  This polished, character-driven drama is a whole lot of movie, in both good and bad ways. While the film lacks the originality of many of the films it tries to emulate, it‚Äôs still a solidly crafted reminder of the absurdly tragic fate that our current housing system appears to be guiding us towards.  Concrete Utopia is an entertaining movie that explores the themes with surprising twists and turns by examining humanity‚Äôs perspective of good and evil people. ‚ÄúConcrete Utopia‚Äù is more ambitious than its execution, but nonetheless sustains its suspense with an emotional journey into the depths of what scarcity can do to humanity.  For those who don't understand that THE WALKING DEAD is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones, director Tae-hwa Eom and co-writer Lee Shin-ji's CONCRETE UTOPIA might be able to drive the point home. ""Triangle of Sadness"" meets ""Lord of the Flies"" in this entertaining post-apocalyptic disaster film that explores the class warfare and unchecked tribalism that‚Äôs rotting the heart of modern society.  With great production design, compelling performances all around, and a sufficiently layered script, it asks more soaring questions about humanity's capacity for violence when pushed to the brink just as it builds its broken world from the ground up. Its lack of originality is at least partially offset by its gripping depiction of intolerance and exclusion as impediments to survival. Shot through with shards of dark humor, ‚ÄúConcrete Utopia‚Äù observes how quickly we dehumanize the needy when they threaten our survival ‚Äî and asks if we can be blamed for doing so. Though it may not be particularly inventive, Concrete Utopia is a careful and poignant addition to the apocalyptic utopian subgenre.
 While it does feel long at times, especially given its 130-minute runtime, the film‚Äôs captivating narrative and skillfully constructed action sequences consistently make it difficult to look away from the screen.","Way too overrated. I am guessing it's latest trend. Theme "" A man is a wolf to another man."" being told by typical way. Lots of gossip and class clash. Effects are bad. Setting doesn't make sense. Characters are mere plot devices. If there was any justice in the world, Park Bo Young would be nominated for an Oscar Exceptional story-telling of a diaster-thriller film. In other films of the same genre typically the story takes place during a disaster with loaded action shows and heroic characters. Concrete Utopia focuses on the aftermath with a realistic portrayal of human nature in their quest for survival. best foreigh movie of the years Somewhat predictable plot twist but the beauty of the movie is how relatable and you would feel the characters' action is justified despite being ethically questionable. Like how can you be still sane during such an insane circumstances.
We feel the domino effect of one action leadings to reaction of many others. Most post apocalyptic movies show the survivors devolving into some weird religious or sci fi related cult.  This one is much more realistic, showing how people would actually react to the scenario.  This is a fascinating study of ordinary people dealing with incredibly trying circumstances.  Very well done. So well executed and well-acted I don't even care that it doesn't have anything new to offer. A very original idea but flawed with some gaping holes of logic.  Without giving up any spoilers, picture no electricity, and yet a family has a murdered corpse in a taped-up freezer and yet no one complains about the smell?  A building with a small population is somehow able to hold off a horde of 10s of thousands.  Suspended disbelief makes this movie enjoyable but must an audience be asked to do that? Plot and casting was good but the storyline is just üëé
The ending literally made it worst . The movie brilliantly delves into the moral quandary of survival in a post-apocalyptic world, posing the question of where to draw the line. Young Tak's character represents the extreme, willing to do whatever it takes, even at the expense of others, while Myeong Hwa embodies the pursuit of humanity, and Minseong grapples with the middle ground. Lee Byung Hun's acting is nothing short of terrifying, while Park Seo Jun shines. However, it's Park Bo Young who truly steals the show, delivering emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact. The film keeps you glued to the screen, and director Uhm Tae Hwa's genius move to blend psychological thriller and crime mystery elements with the post-apocalyptic setting makes this one of the best in its genre. Congratulations to the entire team for crafting a masterpiece. A post-apocalyptic thriller about the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, ""Concrete Utopia"" follows the story that begins when survivors gather at Hwang Goong Apartments, the only building left in earthquake-ravaged Seoul.
Incredible performances and an ending that leaves us thinking for hours. a noteworthy movie indeed.

questions in mind pop up: 
- what would you do if you are in the same situation? 
- will you help others or will you help yourself first to survive?

many might think that this movie is only all about disaster and survival. mostly yes but it has little touches of different genres making it a masterpiece. it's a combination of drama, comedy, disaster, survival, humanity, character perspectives and development, and a pinch of romance. singing and dancing are also shown in the movie. 

the way each character develops into either good or bad, all of them have their lessons learned in the end. this movie showed how different ordinary people react to certain situations ‚Äî uncontrollably mad or a helping hand. 

either way, their decisions are affected due to the people around them and the environment they're living in.


lessons :

1. A ""leader"" is not always right.
2. Don't stay in a place where people are trying to change you.
3. You cannot do everything all the time. learn to listen.
4. ""truths"" covered with lies will eventually be revealed.
5. Learn to control your emotions. Brutality and superiority are not the keys to win any situation. Poor script. It doesn't give viewers a chance to know or invest in any of the main characters before the earthquake hits. Terrific CGI but no character arcs. Too many repeat beats. Good acting, especially LBH, but the script feels totally one-note. A film supposed to be about basic humanity that, ironically, never lets us in. really bad plot and very boring (worst disaster film i've ever watched). A gripping ,ironic disaster thriller that shows the barrier of humanity between their nature self and their importance between theirselves and the others! This film packs a meaning and it's a really disturbing film. There's of course flaws like introducing a main characters 60 minutes in and kills the character off for no reason. The film is still great and really packs a punch. Not really recommend to watch. 20 mins into the movie I feel like leaving the cinema. One of the worst disaster movie I had ever seen. The movie plot is silly and boring."
Action,indiana_jones_and_the_dial_of_destiny,"And while the story is bombastic, is still better than aliens. With that in mind, I'll give the film a B-, its not perfect, but if you settle in, you can enjoy one last adventure. Despite the weirdly ambivalent headlines and mixed reviews dogging this film since its bow at Cannes, this is one of the most consistently enjoyable legacy sequels of recent years. It‚Äôs fun; it‚Äôs wacky; it works. The final Indiana Jones entry is actually near the top of what is a usually dismal filmic phenomenon: closing chapters of long-running action vehicles. But what's missing is any sense of urgency in the story, or any sense of charisma from Ford himself. has enough throwback charm, humor, and attention to character that it comes close to earning its spot in a franchise that frankly should have ended with Indy riding off into the sunset in Last Crusade Without Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just a professional and innocuously pop-corn movie: a compilation of ""greatest hits"" by an emblematic character of a type of cinema that is fading away. [Full review in Spanish] It may have squiffy CG, a perhaps too extended opening, and repetitious set pieces of evasion and capture, but Mangold sticks the emotional and thematic landing ...  The acting throughout ‚ÄúIndiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny‚Äù is solid and the special effects are, as expected, state of the art. Composer John Williams is present for the musical thrills.
 This a movie for the nostalgia-minded. Between the score and extensive de-aging of Harrison Ford from 79 years to 37, it‚Äôs as if we weren‚Äôt 42 years from Raiders of the Lost Ark and we can almost feel like we‚Äôre watching installments filmed back to back. Dial of Destiny manages to be the complete opposite ‚Äî the rare legacy sequel content with simply saying goodbye. Telling a poignant story about our relationship with nostalgia and how attempts to cling to the past prevent us from living in the present.
 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is cluttered and visually problematic, but never hopeless. The terrible final act torpedoes any chance of this film being deemed worthy of the franchise. The exaggerated plot that seems without rhyme or reason, prevents you from savoring it to the fullest. It may be the nostalgia of the well-thought-out movies of the saga, but ""The dial of destiny"" fails at that important point. {Full Review in Spanish}

 Considering the gravitas of Ford‚Äôs performance ‚Äî which channels such profound grief ‚Äî the disconnectedness between his acting and the rest of the film only serves to underline how the movie fails in reconciling with death.  Dial of Destiny delivers on all its promises from breathless action and the sweetest love story (Indy travels with Marion‚Äôs photograph) to a historical Macguffin with a touch of supernatural and finished with that rousing score from John Williams. Not much has changed for Indiana Jones. Admittedly, the relic in question is more niche than the Ark or the Holy Grail ‚Äî but otherwise, The Dial of Destiny is right in the mold of every other Indiana Jones installment, a swashbuckling adventure film. The latest offering is entertaining but there‚Äôs no real magic. It is a production that hits all the right nostalgic notes despite a script that stumbles between paying homage to past works and trying to bring some originality to the tale. The genuinely entertaining beginning (featuring younger Indy fighting Nazis) and heartfelt final sequence are excellent. It‚Äôs what falls between these bookends that grows tiresome.  Harrison Ford as the archeologist icon has a grizzled, grumpy sort of melancholy that refuses pity, self or other, for a failing body and life. It is the saving grace of a film that at times falls into a simulacrum of what the franchise should deliver. Proves that sometimes it is best not to unearth the relics of the past in the corrosive air of a creatively corrupt present.","Great conclusion and a farewell to an iconic hero. It was ok. The usual Indiana Jones chases the Maguffin. There were some funny pokes at Harrison Ford's age. Better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but not by much. Dreadful, unimaginative and busy rewriting history for today's audience.

Will Disney ever make another decent movie?? Will be cancelling Disney+ until they move out of this quagmire. They should take a look at Apple and work out that less is more... Wow, this really fell short of my already low expectations. Utterly boring and soulless. Lucasfilm just cannot make anything at all entertaining. Disney as a whole hasn't made anything passable in several years. Hollywood, please make something original. I beg you! You will never recapture the joy of the original IPs you have gobbled up. Invest in creators, not IP The only reason Indiana Jones goes on this adventure is because he was accused of murder and had no other choice. Otherwise this is Helena Shaw's movie and she is about as enigmatic as dirt.  Action scenes involving Harrison or Phoebe are neither believable or entertaining.  (I understand Indiana Jones movies are fantasy).  There is a reason Spielberg did not make this movie; it should not have been made. Dial of Destiny is a significant step up from its predecessor, but this franchise is getting as old and tired as its chief character. Harrison Ford returns as the handsome, swashbuckling archeologist for one last action-packed adventure to fight nazis and save the world. Placed perfectly in his element, Indiana Jones does what he does best, offering a fun ride through all-too-familiar territory. The opening scene features a digital de-aging of Ford, which looks weirdly computer-generated when in motion. Most of the action occurs during long chase sequences that quickly become repetitive. And finally, the new characters could have been more impressionable, especially Pheobe Waller-Bridge's Dr. Shaw, who I didn't find very likable. Nevertheless, Dial of Destiny is a satisfying conclusion to the Indiana Jones saga with plenty of nostalgic references to delight fans and twists for casual viewers. I've always had a special place in my heart for Indiana Jones so I was sceptical about then new one with thoughts of it being a quick cash grab.

However, after watching the film finally tonight on Disney +, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The return of some familiar faces and the nostalgia of seeing Ford back in action was great. The series has finished on a high note, I think Indiana has had the perfect ending. Who is being kind to this movie? Let's call it what it is‚Ä¶.a big budget pile of dung! All they had to do is to recreate the magic of films 1&3 and presto. No but no they went with the recipe of films 2&4! Seriously peopl have been eating this at 60% plus. Not even close to 20% the casting is so out of touch , let's not talk about the plot! Even the worst Bond movie cuts it more than this. Ein dampfender Haufen Scheisse I enjoyed this an fantastic film. Plenty of action.

The laws of time travel seems off in it though as the watch shows what it is but they talk like it's different (although Doctor Who which is fantastic has new laws every episode)

I'd recommend watching it. Let's hope for a Short round spinoff not as good as the first 3 solid film , better than crytal skull, solid acting and story , interesting story , not bad Buena pel√≠cula, pero no le llega ni a los talones a la trilog√≠a original. Esta cinta es el cierre del personaje de Indiana Jones, por lo tanto tenia muchas expectativas en que le den un gran cierre a este ic√≥nico personaje, y en mi opini√≥n se lo dieron pero podr√≠a haber sido mucho mejor por algunos aspectos que no me convencieron. Lo principal es que la pel√≠cula es bastante larga, y en algunos momentos se me hizo algo pesada y no es tan f√°cil de ver como las cuatro anteriores; no me parece aburrida pero siento que en las otras pel√≠culas pasaban mas cosas para mantener un ritmo algo mas fresco y entretenido. La secuencia inicial con Indy joven se me hizo espectacular, es una aventura digna del personaje y lo √∫nico que le noto malo es el rejuvenecimiento, ya que si bien no esta para nada mal se nota bastante y hasta parece un videojuego. En general los efectos no son la gran cosa, est√°n bien en algunos momentos pero tambi√©n hay escenas que se ven bastante mal. El cierre de la pel√≠cula incluyendo viajes en el tiempo me pareci√≥ fant√°stico, ya que nunca cre√≠ ver esto en una pel√≠cula de Indiana Jones y era una de las cosas que le faltaba a la franquicia. Otra cosa a comentar es el personajes de Helena, el cual me pareci√≥ de lo peor de la pel√≠cula, no me gusto para nada, es insoportable y hasta odioso, tratando mal a nuestro ic√≥nico protagonista y queriendo siempre ser protagonista. Adem√°s, el personaje de Teddy se me hizo algo innecesario, es una especie de Tap√≥n pero menos carism√°tico. Por otro lado, no me gusto lo que hicieron con el personaje de Mutt, creo que era un personaje con el que pod√≠an hacer mucho mas y le pod√≠an dejar el legado de Indy a alguien tan importante como a su hijo, haci√©ndolo un mejor personaje en comparaci√≥n con lo visto en la cuarta entrega. Tambi√©n, me gustaron mucho las referencias a cintas anteriores y las vueltas de los personajes de Sallah y Marion. Por ultimo, los villanos no son la gran cosa, el villano principal esta bastante bien pero no al nivel de los anteriores de la franquicia, y sus secuaces como Klaber son algo decepcionantes y son uno mas del mont√≥n. En cuanto al final, se me hizo muy emotivo, ya que creo que es un gran cierre para el personaje, y me encanto la vuelta de Marion para darle un final ""feliz"" a Indy, ya que a pesar de haber tenido una vida dif√≠cil pudo seguir adelante en parte gracias a su esposa; y es genial como concluye con un plano en el que vuelve a agarrar el sombrero, siendo el √∫nico que puede portarlo. En conclusi√≥n, una buena pel√≠cula, es una gran cinta de aventuras que sirve como un emotivo cierre para este ic√≥nico personaje, en la que sus √∫nicos fallos son tener una historia algo pesada en cuanto a su duraci√≥n y algunos personajes de los que esperaba mucho mas. La recomiendo. I rewatched the first 4 IJ movies to prep myself for the latest instalment of the franchise but didn't actually get around to seeing it until now!

Honestly after all the negativity it got j was expecting the worst but Dial of Destiny really isn't bad at all. In fact it's probably tied with The Last Crusade for me as my 2nd favorite from the franchise?

It has all the qualities of a solid IJ film. Strong cast/chemistry, good action set pieces, human relationships, pushes the boundaries of wonder/possiblity and emphasises Indie as an archeologist.

I think the franchise is just dated and no matter how good of a job they did with this film it's just impossible to modernize Dr. Jones while keeping the same elements that made it iconic. Indiana Jones should have stopped at 3. Hollywood has no new ideas. Just the beginning sequence alone rates a classic Indiana 5 stars. The rest of the movie is good enough although the ending was crazy and not satisfying. Harrison and the cast were great and we do get a gem of appearance from John Rys Davies as Sallah again. It's a movie you have to see many times to appreciate all aspects but, in general, it perpetuates the great Indiana Jones legacy. Sorry I watched it. Real junk. As soon as it had Nazis in the first five minutes I knew the movie sucked Don't watch it nobody wanted in Indiana Jones 5 after that garbage Crystal the skull movie Harrison Ford is old die already we don't care about you or you're fucking movies you've already made two good movies Like Chevy Chase The Dial of Destiny is a marked improvement from the Crystal Skull. This is a great send-off of the eponymous character. It is definitely the rare two hour movie that does not feel quite that long. With explosive action sequences, and stylish set pieces, the action-adventure clips along at a swift pace. It does not break any new ground, but is a solid addition to the Indiana canon. While it may not be as fast paced as the originals, they don't try to make Indy the same character. Like Ford himself, they lean into Indy being older and wiser. But he can still rock the whip just like the old days!"
