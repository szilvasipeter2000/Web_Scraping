       "\"so slow and the plot is terrible. I agree the acting is fine and the directing is good just hated the story. Good story, good acting, but too long and too transparent. herein is over 3 hours of my journey... somewhat ironically, it definitely presents the challenging journey of others, in nearly slow motion... this likely will feel particularly uncomfortable. i respectfully watched everything produced, in its entirety. please find your own opinion. if you're still reading this you might agree to the failure of editing. assuredly, make certain you have have caffeine or alternative, as this feature could induce dozing. An instant classic. Scorsese perfected the movie formula a while ago and this is just another incredible example. If you are up for some slow pace but good performance from the leads its the movie for you. Scorsese missed so many important facts for this story.  Location of the Osage Agency, the BIA offices, plus the courthouse were ALL in Pawhuska, not Fairfax.     These locations are the actual places of several events.    Not including the murders in Fairfax.    \\nBirth of the FBI ??  Outright lie Scorsese!\\nTeddy Roosevelt established the FBI  in 1908.   Look it up.    Also the Million Dollar Elm- That's where millions in lease deals were made.   Again in Pawhuska. \\n\\nI know.  I grew up there. Being of a true event, greed and oppression overshadowing the root of humanity love highlighted the sad reality of life. The movies transparency is much needed. Depressing yet meaningful movie with great acting by DiCaprio and DeNiro.  At 3h50m with previews, the movie is exceedingly long; you will need to take a few bathroom breaks to see it, but it tells the tale of the robbery and killing of the Osage people with amazing detail.  Almost all the main characters in the movie die or end up in jail, so there is little time for happier side stories.  Unfortunately, the deaths and killings are sprinkled in about every 20-30 minutes, so any suspense there might have been gives way to a sick feeling when yet another one happens.  The story to me was the weakest part with very few positive moments of intimacy between characters; it could have used a little more sex.  On the good side, the scenery was spot on as much of the movie was filmed in Oklahoma, and DiCaprio's Oklahoma accent sounded not only authentic but authentic for that particular time and place.  Overall a well-done movie, though the plot was almost too involved to be filmed. I found this film to\""
